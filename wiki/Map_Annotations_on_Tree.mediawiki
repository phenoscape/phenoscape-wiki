==Display qualities using a grid of colored tiles==

* Qualities are displayed with consistent location and color in the grid
* Desaturated colors are used for qualities of phenotypes that are inferred, rather than annotated
** Note annotation to Ictaluridae in this and next candidate example
* The 16 tile designs are intended to support expansion of the list of qualities used in curation - as has already happened.

==Display qualities using colored icons strung along branches==
* Qualities are displayed with consistent icon, color and relative position along branches
* As above, desaturated colors are used for inferred qualities
* Additional icons may be added
