The logo might as well be more abstract. I'm thinking it ought to be
possible to photoshop one of those bizarre looking stained fish bones
into an abstract image that's as edgy as the project name. And wouldn't
that be morph(ing a )phen(otyp)e?

morph into one another, similar to what CAS fish department has on their
