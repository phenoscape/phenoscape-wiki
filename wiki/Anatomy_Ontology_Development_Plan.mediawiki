title: Anatomy Ontology Development Plan
---

The Phenoscape project is coordinating the development and integration of multispecies and single species ontologies for teleosts, zebrafish, amphibians, Xenopus, amniotes, and mouse.  The focus of ontology development in year 1 is the limb/fin skeletal branch.

The development of these ontologies follows OBO Foundry principles. Importing ontology terms is the preferred mechanism for using shared terms and VAO will be imported into TAO, AAO, and AMAO. However, the existing model organism databases are largely hardcoded to reference identifiers for their own ontologies (e.g., MGI database reads MA term identifiers). In the long terms, we will be exploring importing terms from external ontologies. In the interim, the existing MOD vertebrate ontologies will duplicate shared terms with cross-references to equivalent terms in external ontologies.

== Year 1 Development Plan ==

=== Vertebrate Anatomy Ontology (VAO) ===
VAO will be expanded to include terms in the muscular and skeletal systems that are shared by two or more multispecies vertebrate ontologies. These shared terms will be obsoleted from and subsequently imported into the multispecies ontologies.  For example, ‘femur’, a term applicable to AAO and AMAO, will be added to VAO and imported into AMAO (Year 1) and AAO (Year 2).  Terms shared by a multispecies ontology and its corresponding single-species ontology (e.g., AAO and XAO) would also ideally be imported from the multispecies ontology into the single species ontology (or rather, a single ontology for that taxonomic group could be used). However, because MODs currently cannot import terms, shared terms will instead be duplicated in single species ontologies and cross-referenced to the term in the external ontology. For example, because XAO and AAO both contain ‘radio-ulna’, the term XAO term will cross-reference the AAO ID for radio-ulna.

'''Next target release date:''' Late August 2011

'''Features:'''
*New skeletal terms for the limb/fin and cranial skeleton will be added based on work done at the Phenotype RCN Vertebrate Working Group meeting in Boulder, CO (June 1-3, 2011)
*Terms from external ontologies (GO, PATO, Cell) will be cross-referenced

=== Teleost Anatomy Ontology (TAO) ===

'''Next target release date:''' Late August 2011

'''Features:'''
*VAO musculo-skeletal terms will be imported, and existing TAO terms applicable outside of Teleostei will be obsoleted and added to VAO for subsequent import

=== Amphibian Anatomy Ontology (AAO) ===
As a long term goal, AAO and XAO will be aligned and XAO terms will cross reference their AAO parents. However, because AAO development is not scheduled for the first year, AAO will be merged into XAO and development of AAO frozen until year 2. Specifically, AAO terms applicable to Xenopus will be given two IDs (an XAO ID and AAO alt-ID), and those not applicable to Xenopus will be given a single ID (the AAO ID with new XAO prefix). In year 2, AAO terms will be exported and AAO development restarted for curation of amphibian publications. XAO will retain xrefs to AAO terms and the two ontologies will be synchronized regularly. AAO will import VAO terms, and any AAO terms applicable outside of Amphibia will be obsoleted and added to VAO for subsequent import.

'''Next target release date:''' Late August 2011

'''Features:
*children of "unclassified anatomical entity" will be given appropriate is_a parents

After this release, AAO will be merged into XAO and its development frozen until curation begins in Year 2 (see XAO plan, below). At that time, AAO will be exported out of XAO (with XAO retaining xrefs to AAO terms).

=== Amniote Anatomy Ontology (AMAO) ===
'''Next target release date:'''

'''Features:
*In the initial release of AMAO, musculo-skeletal terms from VAO and non-skeletal terms from the Uber Anatomy Ontology [http://obofoundry.org/cgi-bin/detail.cgi?id=uberon (Uberon)] will be imported

=== Zebrafish Anatomical Ontology (ZFA) ===
ZFA terms are cross referenced to TAO terms, and these cross references will be maintained and updated as needed. In addition, cross references to VAO musculo-skeletal terms will be added.

'''Next target release date:'''

'''Features:'''

=== Xenopus Anatomy Ontology (XAO) ===

AAO will be merged into XAO. AAO terms applicable to Xenopus will be given two IDs (XAO ID and AAO alt-ID), and those not in Xenopus will have a single ID (the AAO ID with new XAO prefix). AAO terms will be exported in Year 2 when curation of amphibian publications begins. XAO will retain xrefs to AAO terms.

'''Next target release date:'''

'''Features:'''
* Cross references to VAO musculo-skeletal terms will be added
* AAO terms merged with XAO terms

=== Mouse Adult Gross Anatomy (MA) ===
'''Next target release date:'''

'''Features:
* Cross references to VAO musculo-skeletal terms will be added
