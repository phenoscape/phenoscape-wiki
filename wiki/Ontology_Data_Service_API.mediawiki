title: Ontology Data Service API
---

==Overview==

Data services have been implemented as part of the Phenoscape application to retrieve data about evolutionary and model organism phenotypes. Ancillary services function in the auto completion of partially entered search terms by retrieving matching terms from the database, query relevant summary information on search terms, and retrieve any stored homology information about the search terms. This page details the functioning of each of these services, which make up the very first implementation of the Phenoscape application. 

==Service definitions==

===Basic Data Services===

# Auto completion service
#* Function: Obtain matching term names for a partial term name string
#* Input: partial term name string, a list of ontology IDs, search parameters (search names only or synonyms only or both)
#* Output: matches as records of term name or synonym that was hit, and how the term was hit (name or synonym)
# Term info service
#* Function: Obtain the full term information for a given term
#* Input: a term ID
#* Output: the definition and synonyms for the term. In addition, all the parent and child terms of this term are returned. For terms from the Teleost Taxonomy Ontology, their rank and extant/extinct information are returned as well.
#Homology information service
#* Function: Obtain homology information for the given anatomical entity. This is applicable only for anatomical entities
#* Input: term ID for the anatomical entity
#* Output: homology information for the given entity, with references and evidence codes

===Phenotype Data Service===

# Login
#* Function: Given a username and secret, obtain an authentication token
#* Input:
#* Output:
# Save EQ statements
#* Function: Save an array of EQ statements to the data store
#* Input: a list of EQ statements on OBD-xml or pheno-xml format
#* Output: success/failure indicator
# Load EQ statements
#* Function: Load an array of EQ statements from the data store
#* Input: author, or list of taxa,
#* Output: matching EQ statements in pheno-xml or pheno-syntax format
#* Notes: do we need parameter of list of entities to obtain EQs for?

===Query languages===

* SPARQL

===Data exchange formats===

* Plain text over HTTP:
** OBO format
** YAML
** JSON

* XML over HTTP:
** OBO-XML format
** OBD-XML format

* RDF over HTTP:
** RDF/XML
** RDF/N-triples

==Other ontology service definitions==

* [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ontology-lookup/ Ontology Lookup Service (OLS)] at the EBI. <cite>cote2006</cite> According to the website, the OLS can integrate any ontology available in OBO format. OLS is implemented as a web-service. The website has documentation on

**  OLS also provides 3 ReST-style services, similar to some of the lookups described above.  These queries return a simple key-value XML format.
