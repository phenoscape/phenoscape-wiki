title: Individual-based taxonomy

Representing evolutionary lineages using ontological individuals has some modeling advantages, and may be more realistic, compared with using a simple class hierarchy. We described some of the rationale in [http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-833/paper82.pdf these ICBO conference proceedings]. For the purposes of the Phenoscape KB,  this model supports specification of the [[Semantics_of_phenotype_annotations|semantics of particular phenotype annotations]]: the phenotype applies to all members of a clade, is observed for some members, or is applied to the ancestor of the members.

In the KB build process, the VTO taxon class hierarchy is translated into a relationship graph. For every class relationships such as:

 Class: Ictaluridae
     SubClassOf: Siluriformes

Individuals with the same IDs (using OWL punning) are created with a relationship such as:

 Individual: Ictaluridae
     Facts: subCladeOf Siluriformes

The properties used in the evolutionary lineage model are currently held in the [http://purl.org/phenoscape/vocab.owl Phenoscape KB vocabulary ontology] (a holding place for KB-specific and preliminary terms). These include the inverse property pairs subCladeOf/containsClade (taxon to taxon) and memberOf/hasMember (organism to taxon/taxon to organism). subCladeOf is transitive, and also a member of a given taxon is inferred to be a member of all taxa containing that taxon (using a property chain).
