title: Individual-based taxonomy
---

Representing evolutionary lineages using ontological individuals has some modeling advantages, and may be more realistic, compared with using a simple class hierarchy. We described some of the rationale in [http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-833/paper82.pdf these ICBO conference proceedings]. For the purposes of the Phenoscape KB,  this model supports specification of the [[Semantics_of_phenotype_annotations|semantics of particular phenotype annotations]]: the phenotype applies to all members of a clade, is observed for some members, or is applied to the ancestor of the members.
