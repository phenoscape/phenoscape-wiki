title: CharaParser
---

CharaParser is a natural-language processing tool which analyzes the text of character and character state descriptions to produce a structured output. It was initially developed in [https://sites.google.com/site/biosemanticsproject/ "Fine-Grained Semantic Markup of Descriptive Data for Knowledge Applications in Biodiversity Domains"]. We are adapting it to generate proposals for ontological phenotype annotations. When it is ready, we plan to integrate it with Phenex, so that data curators can take advantage of natural-language processing to accelerate their workflow.
