CharaParser is a natural-language processing tool which analyzes the text of character and character state descriptions to produce a structured output. It was initially developed in [http://sites.google.com/site/biosemanticsproject/ the "Fine-Grained Semantic Markup of Descriptive Data for Knowledge Applications in Biodiversity Domains" project]. We are adapting it to generate proposals for ontological phenotype annotations. When it is ready, we plan to integrate it with [[Phenex]], so that data curators can take advantage of natural-language processing to accelerate their workflow.


A prototype of adapted CharaParser participated in the BioCreative 2012 Workshop with [[Phenex]]. The evaluation results showed that CharaParser was quite capable of identifying candidate entity and quality phrases (it outperformed biocurators by 20% in recall on average), but it had difficulty translating candidate phrases to ontology terms. This is the area we are currently working on.
