==Notes==

AA - Important to note difference in naming conventions between genetic terminology and diversity terminology

TV - Ontologies are meant to solve this problem - can map synonym terms to each other

EJ - many natural phenotypes are much more subtle than genetic mutants

TV - that is an advantage of relationships in ontology - can tell that phenotypes are related to the same morphology

AA - only some phenotypes will overlap - the types of variation are different

TV - but at least both may be annotated as affecting the same part of morphology
