==Notes==

AA - Important to note difference in naming conventions between genetic terminology and diversity terminology

TV - Ontologies are meant to solve this problem - can map synonym terms to each other

EJ - many natural phenotypes are much more subtle than genetic mutants

TV - that is an advantage of relationships in ontology - can tell that phenotypes are related to the same morphology

AA - only some phenotypes will overlap - the types of variation are different

TV - but at least both may be annotated as affecting the same part of morphology

AA - user may want to be able to see traits at various levels within ontology - see everything within the tail or just one vertebra


TV - Covariance matrix can provide table of co-occurring changes in entities on tree

EJ - there are many complicated ways for doing character reconstruction - user will probably want to get data and run themselves

HH - especially in the case of parsimony, can't always treat transition probabilities as equal

HH & EJ - maybe provide some default methods, such as parsimony, maybe allowing specifying of transition models

EJ - co-ocurrrence table will be useful for eyeballing interesting groupings

EJ - also want to see which traits are related to the same genes

HH - this should be either location of expression in both entities, or same type of effect in both entities
