title: OWL modeling of EQ phenotypes
---

This page documents OWL class expressions for particular categories of phenotypes modeled as EQs. This is to provide explicit examples of EQs representing common character types and also to help clarify a classification of phenotypes. This classification will be helpful when communicating about these phenotypes and also for directing design of curatorial user interfaces facilitating input of various types of EQs.  The examples all use the [[http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-manchester-syntax/ OWL Manchester syntax]].

==Basic phenotype==
A quality of a singe physical entity. Example: “sigmoid-shaped supraorbital bone”:

'''sigmoid''' that ''inheres_in'' some '''supraorbital_bone'''

==Relational phenotype==
Relational qualities are those that exist between multiple entities. For example, “parietal fused with supraoccipital” is represented as:

'''fused_with''' that ''inheres_in'' some '''parietal''' and ''towards'' some '''supraoccipital'''

==Comparative phenotype==
In the systematics literature, the size of a structure is often compared to the size of different structure, or it is compared to the same structure in another taxon.

===Compared to another structure===
For example, an author may compare the length of one bone relative to another (e.g., state 0: "frontal length greater than parietal length" vs. state 1: frontal length shorter than parietal length"). State 0 is represented as:

'''length''' that ''inheres_in'' some '''frontal''' and ''increased_in_magnitude_relative_to'' some ('''length''' that ''inheres_in'' some '''parietal''')

===Compared to same structure in another taxon===
Comparison of the length of one bone across species (e.g., “state 0: frontal large” vs. “state 1: frontal small”, with taxonomic distribution recorded in the character by taxon matrix).

====Reference to a particular taxon====
When referencing a particular (possibly outgroup) taxon:

'''length''' that ''inheres_in'' some '''frontal''' and ''increased_in_magnitude_relative_to'' some ('''length''' that ''inheres_in'' some '''frontal''' and ''in_taxon'' some '''Ictaluridae''')

====Local relative phenotypes without explicit taxonomic references====
"Anonymous" relative length classes must be defined for the character and then used across all phenotype annotations for that character:

Class: '''character_1_state_0'''
* EquivalentTo: '''length''' and ''inheres_in'' some '''frontal''' and ''increased_in_magnitude_relative_to'' some '''character_1_state_1'''

Class: '''character_1_state_1'''
* EquivalentTo: '''length''' and ''inheres_in'' some '''frontal''' and ''decreased_in_magnitude_relative_to'' some '''character_1_state_0'''

==Presence/absence phenotype==

==Count phenotype==

==Measurements==
