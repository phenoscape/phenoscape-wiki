title: OWL modeling of EQ phenotypes
---

This page documents OWL class expressions for particular categories of phenotypes modeled as EQs. This is to provide explicit examples EQs representing common character types and also to help clarify a classification of phenotypes. This classification will be helpful when communicating about these phenotypes and also for directing design of curatorial user interfaces facilitating input of various types of EQs.

==Basic phenotype==
A quality of a singe physical entity. Example: “sigmoid-shaped supraorbital bone”

'''sigmoid''' that ''inheres_in'' some '''supraorbital_bone'''

==Relational phenotype==
Relational qualities are those that exist between multiple entities. For example, “parietal fused with supraoccipital” is represented as:

'''fused_with''' that ''inheres_in'' some '''parietal''' and ''towards'' some '''supraoccipital'''

==Comparative phenotype==
In the systematics literature, the size of a structure is often compared to the size of different structure, or it is compared to the same structure in another taxon. For example, an author may compare the length of one bone relative to another (e.g., state 0: "frontal length greater than parietal length" vs. state 1: frontal length shorter than parietal length"). State 0 is represented as:

'''length''' that ''inheres_in'' some '''frontal''' and ''increased_in_magnitude_relative_to'' some ('''length''' that ''inheres_in'' some '''parietal''')

Comparison of the length of one bone across species (e.g., “state 0: frontal large” vs. “state 1: frontal small”, with taxonomic distribution recorded in the character by taxon matrix) is represented either with reference to a particular (possibly outgroup) taxon or using "anonymous" relative length classes:

'''length''' that ''inheres_in'' some '''frontal''' and ''increased_in_magnitude_relative_to'' some ('''length''' that ''inheres_in'' some '''frontal''' and ''in_taxon'' some '''Ictaluridae''')
