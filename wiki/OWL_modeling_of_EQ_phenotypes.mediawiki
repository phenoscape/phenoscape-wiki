title: OWL modeling of EQ phenotypes
---

This page documents OWL expressions for particular categories of phenotypes modeled as EQs. This is to provide explicit examples EQs representing common character types and also to help clarify a classification of phenotypes. This classification will be helpful when communicating about these phenotypes and also for directing design of curatorial user interfaces facilitating input of various types of EQs.

==Basic phenotype==
A quality of a singe physical entity. Example: “sigmoid-shaped supraorbital bone”

'''sigmoid''' that ''inheres_in'' some '''supraorbital_bone'''

==Relational phenotype==
Relational qualities are those that exist between multiple entities. For example, “parietal fused with supraoccipital” is represented as:

'''fused_with''' that ''inheres_in'' some '''parietal''' and ''towards'' some '''supraoccipital'''
