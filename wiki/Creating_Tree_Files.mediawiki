title: Creating Tree Files
---

The following are instructions for creating and saving trees using [http://mesquiteproject.org/mesquite/mesquite.html Mesquite].  You should have a [http://sourceforge.net/ SourceForge] account and access to the [[Data_Repository_Access_Instructions|Phenoscape Data Repository]] before beginning.

You might begin with an existing nexus file containing the data matrix for the publication, or create a new nexus file containing a list of matrix taxa copied from the Matrix Taxon column in Phenex. 


# Open nexus file in Mesquite. You should see the data matrix wth list of taxa in the left-hand column.
# Next, create a Tree Block (which will contain one or more trees for the publication) by selecting Taxa&Trees > New Empty Block of Trees.  Click OK if Mesquite asks for Name of trees block.
# Click on the “View Trees” icon below “Trees” on the left hand side of the Mesquite window.  You may need to click on the arrow to display the tree icons. 
## A ”default bush” tree will appear.  
# Optional: format the tree display to make it easier to read names manipulate the tree
## go to Drawing > Tree Form > Square Tree
## go to Drawing > Orientation > Right
## go to Drawing > Set Current Orientation as Default
# Modify the tree as needed to replicate the publication tree
# Store the tree by going to Tree>Store Tree As
## Name the tree after the figure number (e.g., Figure 6.). 
# To add additional trees to the file, modify the current tree (e.g., Figure 6) as needed, then go to Tree > Store Tree As
## Name the tree after the new figure number
