title: Taxonomy ontology
---

The taxonomy ontology will be based on the Catalog of Fishes.

==Resources==

Here are some useful resources for creating the taxonomy ontology:

* Chris Mungall's [http://www.berkeleybop.org/ontologies/obo-all/ncbi_taxonomy/ncbi_taxonomy.obo NCBI Taxonomy in OBO format] - ''this file is huge!''
* Catalog of Fishes database [[cof_schema|schema documentation]].
* [http://www.geneontology.org/GO.format.obo-1_2.shtml OBO Flat File Format Specification]
* [http://www.obofoundry.org/wiki/index.php/Identifiers OBO Identifier Lifecycle]

==Taxonomy ontology structure==

The NCBI taxonomy ontology has some special terms and relations which are probably relevant to the fish taxonomy ontology.  One of these is the "has_rank" typedef, which is used as a property value on the taxon terms:

<pre>
[Typedef]
id: has_rank
name: has_rank
def: "A metadata relation between a class and its taxonomic rank (eg species, family)" []
comment: This is an abstract class for use with the NCBI taxonomy to name the depth of the node within the tree. The link between the node term and the rank is only visible if you are using an obo 1.3 aware browser/editor; otherwise this can be ignored
is_metadata_tag: true
</pre>

Some special terms are included which represent taxonomic ranks.  They descend from the term "taxonomic_rank":

<pre>
[Term]
id: NCBITaxon:taxonomic_rank
name: taxonomic_rank
def: "A level of depth within a species taxonomic tree" []
comment: This is an abstract class for use with the NCBI taxonomy to name the depth of the node within the tree. The link between the node term and the rank is only visible if you are using an obo 1.3 aware browser/editor; otherwise this can be ignored

[Term]
id: NCBITaxon:superkingdom
name: superkingdom
is_a: NCBITaxon:taxonomic_rank

[Term]
id: NCBITaxon:genus
name: genus
is_a: NCBITaxon:taxonomic_rank

[Term]
id: NCBITaxon:species
name: species
is_a: NCBITaxon:taxonomic_rank

etc....
