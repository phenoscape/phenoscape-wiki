This is a list of various items that have come up at meetings and other discussions, which don't seem to have made it onto any development plan or roadmap.

===Measurement value literals in OBD (including ranges)===
Phenotypes that include a measurement are not stored without the measurement in OBD, for example "count" or "length" phenotypes.  These values need to be imported and provided to the web interface.
===Measurement input interface supporting ranges for Phenex===
Phenex supports input of a single number for measurements.  Many publications provide ranges, which may or may not be bounded on both sides ("5-10", "more than 7").

===Fully automated dataloader script===
The dataloader should run in an automated way on a server.  It should be easy to install and run from any computer. ''I know Cartik is working on this but I'm not sure it's on a roadmap. --[[User:Jpb15|jim]] 15:53, 19 February 2009 (EST)''
===Polymorphic matrix states in Phenex===
===Search for phenotypes in web interface via anatomy part_of===
===Employing homology statements in data queries (via reasoning?)===
