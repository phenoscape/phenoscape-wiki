<big>**Phenotype Grant Renewal Workshop**</big>  
  
A workshop hosted by the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center
(NESCent)

</center>

## Location and Date

**Venue:** National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NESCent)
(<span class="plainlinks">[directions](http://www.nescent.org/about/directions.php)</span>,
also see <span class="plainlinks">[information for
visitors](http://www.nescent.org/about/information.php)</span>)

**Date:** April 28-29, 2009

**Organizers:** Paula Mabee, Monte Westerfield, Todd Vision

## Introduction

The goal of this workshop is to discuss plans for a renewal of the
Phenoscape NSF grant, to be submitted in July 2009. Specific aims of the
renewal are to be determined by the workshop participants. An initial
list includes creating the informatics tools necessary to integrate and
mediate between different concepts of homology, extending the
systematics legacy data transformation to all vertebrates, and
laboratory case-studies for following up specific hypotheses generated
by the expanding knowledge base.

## Agenda

*Note that this agenda is still in draft stage and may change before the
meeting.*

### Tuesday, Apr. 27, 2009

**Afternoon:**

- EQ support by all involved model organism databases
- Ontology building
- Legacy character transformation

**Specific goals and approaches**

1.  Expand taxonomic coverage of Phenoscape to Vertebrata; vertebrate
    evolutionary skeletal phenotypes associated with skeletal phenotypes
    and associated data from MODs.
    - Expand/develop anatomy ontologies for multispecies ontologies and
      MODs to cover skeleton
      - Teleosts: expand as required for annotation of euteleost
        matrices (year 1)
      - ZFIN (done)
      - Amphibanat
      - XenBase: AO done
      - Amniotes: develop from mammal anatomy ontology core
      - Mouse (done)
    - Develop taxonomy ontologies for vertebrates
      - Teleosts: TTO done
      - Amphibanat: TO status?
      - Amniotes: need to create for extinct archosaurs + birds & croc +
        mammals
    - Annotate skeletal diversity for vertebrates
      - Teleosts: curate euteleost matrices (year 1)
      - ZFIN: back-curate skeletal phenotypes
      - Amphibanat: curation needs?
      - XenBase: expand to cover skeletal mutants/knockouts
      - Amniotes: prioritize and curate key papers
      - Mouse (done)
    - Add developmental time in consistent schema across MODs to support
      new evo-devo queries
      - ZFIN (done)
      - XenBase (done)
      - Mouse (needs to be done as per discussions)
    - Add evolutionary time to support new evo-devo queries; reference
      evo time to taxonomy ontologies
      - Teleosts: need to add to TTO
      - Amphibanat: need to add
      - Amniotes: need to add
    - Synchronize multispecies anatomy ontologies with corresponding
      MODs
      - Teleosts + ZFIN (done)
      - Amphibanat + XenBase (will be done before grant begins)
      - Amniotes + mammals
    - Align three multispecies anatomy ontologies (fishes, amphibian,
      amniotes)
      - create general vertebrate reference ontology (to which each
        multisp ontology maps)
      - create homology table for vertebrate skeletal structures
2.  Add new use cases based on referencing to time-based ontologies and
    phylogenies
    - Developmental time: Predict when in development a particular
      evolutionary phenotype might arise. Given some phenotypic
      evolutionary variation (e.g. presence/absence of scales in
      fishes), find out their developmental origin (cell lineage) and
      timing of development (when in zebrafish they form relative to
      other structures?)
    - Evolutionary time: Determine when a phenotype and its variant
      arose (e.g. when did scales arise and when were they lost?).
      Requires phylogeny, referencing taxa in taxonomy ontology to time.
    - Map annotations on phylogenies;
3.  Specific goal associated with images/morphbank?
4.  Expand database and web interface tools in support of the scientific
    goals
    - expansion of existing db to handle another 30 million annotations?
    - two obds?
5.  Analytical tools/reasoner to search for correlations across
    phenotypes, genes, intersections, on trees, particular
6.  Collaborations
    - Vertnet?
    - Mesquite
    - TreeBASE
    - Morphbank
    - MOD collabs?

## Reading

- Within the Phenoscape project, we have been tagging interesting
  references about phenotype and taxonomy ontologies by using the tag
  "<span class="plainlinks">[phenoscape](http://www.connotea.org/tag/phenoscape)</span>"
  on Connotea. Everyone is welcome to suggest references by using this
  tag.
