title: Semantics of phenotype annotations
---

In Phenoscape data annotation, we typically model a phenotype as a class expression describing a set of organisms, for example <nowiki>'</nowiki>''has_part'' some ('''caudal fin''' and ''bearer_of'' some '''bifurcated''')<nowiki>'</nowiki>. How precisely this phenotype class is related to a taxon has important consequences for the resulting inferences and thus queries for phenotypes across the taxonomy.
