title: Semantics of phenotype annotations
---

In Phenoscape data annotation, we typically model a phenotype as a class expression describing a set of organisms, for example <nowiki>'</nowiki>''has_part'' some ('''caudal_fin''' and ''bearer_of'' some '''bifurcated''')<nowiki>'</nowiki>. How precisely this phenotype class is related to a taxon has important consequences for the resulting inferences and thus queries for phenotypes across the taxonomy. This is most important when making annotations to higher-level taxa. How should these annotations propagate to sub-taxa?

This page assumes that taxa are represented as OWL individuals, and the taxonomy is a tree of ''subclade_of''/''contains_clade'' relationships. For example:

'''''Ictalurus_punctatus''''' ''subclade_of''  '''''Ictalurus''''' ''subclade_of'' '''''Ictaluridae''''' ''subclade_of'' '''''Siluriformes'''''

These are transitive, so that Ictalurus is a ''subclade_of'' Siluriformes. Individual organisms are related to taxa via ''member_of''/''has_member''. A ''member_of'' a taxon X which is a ''subclade_of'' taxon Y is also a ''member_of'' taxon Y.

===Class generalization===
(''member_of'' value '''''Siluriformes''''') subClassOf (''has_part'' some ('''caudal_fin''' and ''bearer_of'' some '''bifurcated'''))

===Ancestral state annotation===

===Observation annotation===
