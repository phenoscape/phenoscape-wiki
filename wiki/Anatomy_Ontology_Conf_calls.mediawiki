== June 13, 2011 ==
Participating: Monte Westerfield, Paula Mabee, Judy Blake, Aaron Zorn, Jeff Bowes, Wasila Dahdul, Jim Balhoff

===Agenda===
* Judy:  
** Discussion on how to initiate the Amniote Anatomy Ontology for terms outside skeletal system  
** Report on status of unified anatomy [emap + MA] 
** What exactly is abstract mouse?
** Clone MA, UBERON, unified mouse [emap + MA], or abstract mouse? 
* Monte: 
** Discussion on moving ZFA to GO like model; possibility of implementing VAO import (so that XAO can just clone this VAO chunk when they also clone the rest of ZFA)
* Aaron and Jeff: 
** Discussion on setting up modular ontology model and specifics of importing model species-specific information (like devo stage)

===Minutes===
* Wasila will demonstrate diffs between Uberon and MA usingnon-skeletal terms
** e.g. 'naris' in mouse is 'part of nose'
** e.g. 'naris' in uberon with lots of xrefs but missing relationship 'part of' olfactory apparatus 
** not sure how often Chris updates Uberon
*Terry - developed adult Mouse Anatomy; working with Edinburgh group to update their ontology
** 'unified mouse anatomy' not an official term, just a descriptor
** Ed. developmental mouse anatomy developed 15 years ago in an effort to code mouse expressiondata.  Built along lines of an atlas by kauffman and baird; partonomy; Used for expression annotation by ... for years now.  Two parts: abstract mouse which is a time -inedpent collection of terms in a hierarhy not a dag; and from that extracted stage-dependent hierarchies.  stage 28 is postnatal -- this is not developed at all.  8-10 years ago, a postnatal developed by jax.  jax added is-a and expanded on stages.  Examined all relevant ontologies in updating.  Two entities (MA vs. developmental) not connected currently -- working to make it an anatomy ontology encompassing the whole of mouse development.  
** Q: re: timeline?  Terry:  within next two weeks could give clearer answer.
