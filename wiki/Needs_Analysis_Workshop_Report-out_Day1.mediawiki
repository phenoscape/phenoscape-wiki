title: Needs Analysis Workshop/Report-out Day1
---

===Evo Group report-out===

* need to improve ontologies, e.g. for describing behavior
* need to improve tools for analyzing images
* covariance of entities, attributes
* broader queries of entities within particular constraints, such as structures
* need capacity to store media (e.g., images, movies)
* need environmental, ecological, and geographical data

===Devo Group report-out===

* identifying homologies among distantly related taxa
** for example, do fishes have digits? E.g., if genes have similar effects on fins as on digit development.
* patterns of covariation
** for example, cusps on mammalian teeth
** could be used to identify "character modules" that are well-connected
** connections within modules should be more stable than between
* for a branch hypothesized to be under positive selection (from e.g. a molecular analysis), identify candidate phenotypes that could have been selected for
** map synapomorphies onto a phylogeny
** identify phenotypes with highest rate of change on that lineage 
** needs phylogeny that is selectable and manipulable
* use the database to point out holes in the knowledge

===Discussion===

* enrichment analysis: given a list of genes, which phenotype terms are overrepresented among them
* capturing representing variation seems to be a general problem and challenge, but critically needed
** variation in regulatory (or morphogenic) gene expression and corresponding phenotypic changes (Hox gene expression example)
** polyphenism: variability of phenotype that can distinguish species but is also  dependent on environmental factors or variable levels of gene expression
** do we need to capture frequencies for polymorphisms to represent variability
** there are morphological differences even between inbred strains, for example for JAX mouse strains in cranial morphology 
* integrating with genomic resources:
** linking out to genome databases seems mandatory
* alerting features
** for example, saving queries as RSS feeds
