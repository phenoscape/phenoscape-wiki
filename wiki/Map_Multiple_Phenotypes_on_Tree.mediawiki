== Map Multiple Phenotypes on Tree ==

=== Version 1 ===
[[Image:MultiplePhenotypesOnTree.png]]

=== Version 0 ===
* user can enter phenotype specification for each "state"
* see on tree which branches exhibit one or both of the phenotypes
* Do users want the tree "pruned"?  Or show branches without annotations also?  could be a lot of taxa

===Same interface===
* shows that the 2 phenotypes don't have to be obvious alternatives
