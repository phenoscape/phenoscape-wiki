==Data loader==
A data loader application to refresh the data in the Phenoscape database on a daily basis is under development. The application is being developed as a Perl module which:
# Downloads curated NeXML files from the Phenoscape SVN repositories
# Drops and recreates the database
# Loads the requisite ontologies into the database
# Loads the data from the curated NeXML files into the database, and
# Invokes the OBD reasoner to elicit implicit information from the data and adds them to the database
