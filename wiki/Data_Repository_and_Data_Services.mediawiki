title: Data Repository and Data Services

==Data loader==
A data loader application to refresh the data in the Phenoscape database on a daily basis is under development. The application is being developed as a Perl module which:
# Downloads curated NeXML files from the Phenoscape SVN repositories
# Drops and recreates the database
# Loads the requisite ontologies into the database
# Loads the data from the curated NeXML files into the database, and
# Invokes the OBD reasoner to elicit implicit information from the data and adds them to the database

==Web services==
Each service may support multiple media types.  The desired media type can be specified by appending <code>?media=json</code> or similar to the request URL.  URI specifications are defined (loosely) using [http://bitworking.org/projects/URI-Templates/draft-gregorio-uritemplate-00.html URI Templates].
===Term info===
'''URI'''

<BASE URI>/term/{term_id}

'''Returns'''

JSON:
<javascript>
{
    "id" : "TAO:0001700",
    "name" : "caudal-fin stay",
    "definition" : "Bone that is located anterior to the caudal procurrent rays. Caudal fin stays are unpaired bone."
    "parents" :
    [
        {
            "relation" : "OBO_REL:is_a",
            "id" : "TAO:0001514",
            "name" : "bone"
        },

        }
    ],
    "children" : [] // if there are children, this content should be in the same format as the parents list
}
// how should xrefs, etc. be represented, property_value definitions?
</javascript>

OWL-RDF:

 Todo...

If there is no term with the given ID, the service should return "404 Not Found".

====Handling of anonymous post-compositions====

===Autocomplete===
'''URI'''

<BASE URI>/term/search/{text}?name=[true|false]&syn=[true|false]&def=[true|false]&ontology=[ont1;ont2;...]

All URI parameters are optional.  Default values are name=true, syn=false, def=false.  The "ontology" parameter should be a semicolon-separated list of ontology prefixes to search within.  If not given, the default is to search all terms.

'''Returns'''

JSON:
<javascript>
[
    {   // overall format
        "id" : "TAO:0001514",
        "name" : "bone",
        "match_type" : "name" | "syn" | "def",
        "match_text" : "this is the term name, synonym name, or definition that matched"
    },
    {   // a name example
        "id" : "TAO:0001514",
        "name" : "bone",
        "match_type" : "name",
        "match_text" : "bone"
    },
    {   // a synonym example
        "id" : "TAO:0001795",
        "name" : "ceratohyal foramen",
        "match_type" : "syn",
        "match_text" : "bericiform foramen"

        "name" : "ceratobranchial bone",
        "match_type" : "def",
        "match_text" : "Ceratobranchials are bilaterally paired cartilage bones that form part of the ventral branchial arches. They articulate medially with the hypobranchials and laterally and dorsally with the epibranchials.  Ceratobranchials 1-5 ossify in the ceratobranchial cartilages."
    }

If there are no terms matching the given input, a document should still be returned, containing an empty results list.
