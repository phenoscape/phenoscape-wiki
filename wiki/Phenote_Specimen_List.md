A user may want to enter a pre-defined list of specimens from which to
repeatedly create different EQ statements. This functionality is
available in an accessory window within Phenote. Launch Phenote and
click on the "View" menu, then select "Specimen List". You should see a
new window like this:

<figure>
<img src="specimen-list.png" title="specimen-list.png" />
<figcaption>specimen-list.png</figcaption>
</figure>

You can fill in the list of specimens from a publication in the same way
you edit the list of characters in the main Phenote window. But, unlike
the main window, this window shows only a subset of fields which serve
to identify specimens. If you would like to create new phenotype
statements using some of these specimens, just check the boxes next to
the ones you would like to work with. By pressing the "Generate
Characters" button, you can create new characters in the main window
with these specimens pre-filled in. All the new characters will be
selected together, so you can bulk edit them to apply the same EQ
statement to them all.
