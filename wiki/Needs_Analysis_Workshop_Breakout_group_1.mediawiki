==Break-out Group 1: Developmental genetics of morphology==

Examples for driving research questions:
* Which genes are known to be expressed in the development of a particular morphological structure? 
* Is there a model organism mutant that has a phenotype similar to a human disease?

Characters

GW - describe natural units
 - not necessarily arbitrary
- can phenotype be decomposed into natural mechanistic units

CK - could ontology hold you back from describing some things

GW - can lead to confusion

EJ - this database can be a way of discovering these units

GW - would database be like GenBank - I could describe a fish and deposit my phenotypes
