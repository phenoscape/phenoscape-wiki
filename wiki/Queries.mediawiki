title: Queries

This section describes the queries that have been implemented for the Phenoscape data services, in addition to the execution details of each queries on the PostgreSQL database.

===Summary===

In the Phenoscape application, queries are assembled in a Java program and dispatched through a connection to the database, and executed at the database end. For brevity's sake, the Java program is called the client side and the database side is called the backend henceforth. The database has been implemented using the [http://www.postgresql.org/ PostgreSQL] Relational Database Management System (DBMS).

Query execution in PostgreSQL occurs in four sequential steps. In the first step, the query is transferred from the client side over the network to the database. In the second step, the query is parsed and an execution plan is drawn up by the PostgreSQL DBMS to retrieve the data as efficiently as possible in terms of time and memory utilization. In the third step, the DBMS executes the query as per the drawn up execution strategy and retrieves the results. In the last step, the retrieved results  are sent back over the connection to the client side.

==Relations of interest==

The relations described in this section are of use in finding information about phenotypes, and are therefore leveraged in the implementation of the phenotype summary and details modules of the Phenoscape application.

Post compositions of Entities and Qualities are used to relate taxa (and genes) and phenotypes through the ''exhibits'' relation as shown in (1) and (2).
<javascript>
Taxon                              exhibits                 inheres_in(Quality, Entity)                                       -- (1)
Gene                               exhibits                 inheres_in(Quality, Entity)                                       -- (2)
</javascript>
In addition, the OBD database also contains information relating post composed phenotypes to both the Quality and the Entity by different relations as shown in (3) and (4) respectively
<javascript>
inheres_in(Quality, Entity)        is_a                     Quality                                                           -- (3)
inheres_in(Quality, Entity)        inheres_in               Entity                                                            -- (4)
</javascript>
Quality is related to Character by the ''value_for'' relation as shown in (5)
<javascript>
Quality                            value_for                Character                                                         -- (5)
</javascript>

Phenotypes can also be traced back to the publications and datasets they are extracted from as explained below. Phenotype data summaries and details retrieved by the services modules of Phenoscape are filtered by publications as well.

Every dataset is associated with a publication as shown in (6). The list of link statements posited by a dataset can be retrieved by traversing the relation shown in (7)
<javascript>
DataSet                            has_publication         Publication                                                        -- (6)
LinkStatement                      posited_by              Dataset                                                            -- (7)
</javascript>
