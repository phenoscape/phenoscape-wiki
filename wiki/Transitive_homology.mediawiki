title: Transitive homology
---

This page explores the transitive closure of the homologous_to relation. Currently in OBD this is a binary class-level relation that holds between two taxon-specific anatomical entities.

I propose the following expansion to OWL-DL instance-level quantified axioms:

  homologous_to(A,B) ==>
  Class: A
  SubClassOf: descendedFrom some (hasDescendant some B)
  Class: B
  SubClassOf: descendedFrom some (hasDescendant some A)

If we make the simplifying assumption that directlyDescendsFrom is functional then it follows that class-level homology is transitive. What are the consequences of making this strong assumption? We can explore this with existing phenoscape data.

! TAO:0000429
! scaphium
! Neural arch and Weberian ossicle that is reduced in size relative to other neural arches.  Scaphium has a process which articulates with the first centrum.
|-
| TAO:0000525
| intercalarium
| Neural arch and Weberian ossicle that has been modified in shape relative to other neural arches. Intercalarium includes three parts: an anterolateral process (the manubrium) which is embedded in the interossicular ligament and the ascending and articulating processes.
|-
| TAO:0000637
| claustrum cartilage
| Postcranial axial cartilage and Weberian ossicle that is located dorsal to the scaphium. The claustrum cartilage is bilaterally paired.
|-
| TAO:0000698
| tripus
| Endochondral bone, membrane bone, and Weberian ossicle that is an element of third vertebra. Anteriorly it attaches to the interosseus ligament and posteriorly it extends as a transformator process embedded in the tunica externa of the swimbladder.
|-
| TAO:0001171
| os suspensorium
| Endochondral bone and Weberian ossicle that is an element of the fourth vertebra that curves ventrally around the anterior head of the swim bladder.
|-
| TAO:0001253
| neural arch 2
| Neural arch that is the second after the neurocranium.
|-
| TAO:0001335
| supradorsal
| Supradorsals are small paired nodules of cartilage positioned at the distal ends of neural arches and the proximal end of neural spines (Arratia et al., 2001).
|-
| TAO:0001396
| parapophysis + rib of vertebra 4
| The parapophysis + rib, fused to the centrum, extends laterally then angles anteroventrally. A thin plate, the os suspensorium fuses to its median surface.
|-
| TAO:0001592
| claustrum bone
| Endochondral bone, membrane bone, and Weberian ossicle that is located dorsal to the scaphium. The claustrum bone is bilaterally paired.
|-
| TAO:0001877
| neural arch 1
| Neural arch that is the anteriormost neural arch.
|-
| TAO:0001878
| rib of vertebra 2
| Rib that articulates with the parapophysis of the second centrum.
|-
| TAO:0001884
| accessory neural arch
| Neural arch that is located posterior to the neurocranium and anterior to neural arch 1.  The accessory neural arch is not associated with a vertebral centrum.
|-
| TAO:0001885
| neural spine 1
| Neural spine that is associated with the first vertebra.
|-
| TAO:0001888
| supraneural 1 bone
| Supraneural bone located dorsal to vertebra 1.
|-
| TAO:0001889
| supraneural 1 cartilage
| Postcranial axial cartilage located dorsal to vertebra 1.

== High Level Overview ==

This is a high level part_of view of all homology relationships, projected onto TAO:

[[Image:TAO-all-p.png]]

* homology statements are generalized to the TAO, taxa not shown
* clusters of homology relationships are shown in 4 distinct boxes
* vertebra clustered into a box
* only relations shown are homology and part_of

Here we can see there are 4 distinct clusters, according to the vertebra number affected

== Otophysi intercalarium ==

this is annotated to be homologous to the neural arch 2 and vertebra 2 in Teleosti. From this, what can be said of the relationship between these two entities?

[[Image:TAO-0000525-TTO-352.png]]

Note that for compactness reasons this diagram doesn't show the part_of relations.

* intercalarium part_of v2

presumably there should be some kind of relationship between "rib of v2" and "v2"

== Otophysi tripus ==

this is annotated to be homologous to (i) the fusion of parapophysis + rib of v3 and (ii) the fusion of parapophysis + rib of v3 + rib of v4 in Teleosti. What can be said from this of the relation between (i) and (ii)
