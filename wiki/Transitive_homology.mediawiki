title: Transitive homology
---

This page explores the transitive closure of the homologous_to relation. Currently in OBD this is a binary class-level relation that holds between two taxon-specific anatomical entities.

I propose the following expansion to OWL-DL instance-level quantified axioms:

  homologous_to(A,B) ==>
  Class: A
  SubClassOf: descendedFrom some (hasDescendant some B)
  Class: B
  SubClassOf: descendedFrom some (hasDescendant some A)



== Otophysi intercalarium ==

this is annotated to be homologous to the neural arch 2 and vertebra 2 in Teleosti. From this, what can be said of the relationship between these two entities?

== Otophysi tripus ==

this is annotated to be homologous to (i) the fusion of parapophysis + rib of v3 and (ii) the fusion of parapophysis + rib of v3 + rib of v4 in Teleosti. What can be said from this of the relation between (i) and (ii)
