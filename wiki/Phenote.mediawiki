title: Phenote

[http://www.phenote.org/ Phenote] is being used for phenotype annotation of mutants within model-organism projects.  It allows the creation of a simple list of phenotype statements, rather than a species-by-character matrix.

Here is sample data in the default configuration:

The input fields in Phenote are highly configurable.  Here is a sample of how Phenote might be configured for the PhenoMap project:

This configuration file can be downloaded [[Media:phenomap.cfg.zip|here]].  Phenote configurations are described in the [http://www.phenote.org/content/howtos/customize.shtml documentation].

This interface ("list of states") may not be optimal for the PhenoMap project, especially if a set of species are expected to be coded for a given set of characters.
