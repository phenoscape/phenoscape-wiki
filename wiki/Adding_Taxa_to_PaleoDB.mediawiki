title: Adding Taxa to PaleoDB

=Introduction=

=Adding taxon names=
#Go to [http://paleodb.org paleodb.org]
#Login (link at the upper right corner of the startup window).  If you are not registered as a contributor, you should specify your supervisor (e.g., Paula or Wasila) as the authorizer, and your name (lastname, first initial, followed by period e.g., Midford, P.) as enterer.  This will take you to the Main Menu.
#The first step is to determine whether the taxon is already entered in PaleoDB. In the ‘Data entry’ column under the heading ‘Basic steps’, click the ‘Add/edit taxon name’ link.  This will take you to a page called ‘Enter the taxon’s full name’.  Enter the name in the Taxon name field (e.g., Loganellia scotica) and click Search.  
#*If a match is found, then we don’t need to worry about it and when we add PBDB to the VTO the name should appear in Phenex.  If the name is already in PBDB, then we don't need to worry unless the containing taxa are not listed in PBDB.  If there are no containing taxa, the VTO update process will attach taxon directly under chordata (which is the default root in our VTO build scripts).
#*If a match is not found, then the Reference search page will appear.  The reference to search for is the paper that you are curating (not the publication where the taxon was originally described!)  You can search by simply entering the author and PBDB to make sure the reference isn’t already there.  You don’t need to specify year or title in the search, but if the author has lots of publications already in the database, adding one of this will shorten the list of returned results.  Click Search.  The resulting page will display a list of matches.
#If there is no match.
