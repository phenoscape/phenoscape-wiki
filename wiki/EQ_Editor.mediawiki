==EQ Editor requirements==

''These requirements are a first stab taken at the PI meeting at NESCent on Feb 26-27, 2007.''

===Morphologist Workflow===

# One reference publication, many species, several characters
#* Have reference publication about taxonomic group, with figures, for skeletal characters
#* May proceed section by section; need to specify section, or figure, or generally part of a reference
#* Need to denote species, choose anatomical entity, choose quality, such as anterior margin, specify value
#* May have questions, or need to input free text comments, e.g., about uncertainties
# Single species, single publication, multiple characters
#* Might also have a paper describing a single species
#* Curator would use a specimen to confirm accuracy of annotation 
# Many species, many publications, single character 
#* May also use a character survey
#* Would use many different papers
#* Would span many different species
# Specimen may be a fossil record
#* Need to record geological time
#* Will do that later
# Specimen-based annotation is not part of the project

* Need to reference "traditional" character: should be able to verbatim quote original character description, also give publication reference; there are often differing, even conflicting, definitions for the same character 
* Need to be able to see what is already present about a particular character; may also need to look at "similar" characters (as defined by, e.g., characters using sibling terms and sibling qualities)
* Need to see the values that have been assigned already for a character

* There may be conflicting character states reported in different publications; the data curator will decide whether these conflicts need to be kept or can be reconciled.
* Verification of characters descriptions and state values by Data Curator or even Morphologist, e.g., using actual specimen(s), and attributing the verification

* Want all annotations to be associated with voucher specimens (may only be a photograph though)

===UI requirements===

For example, the Fink & Fink paper

* start by setting the reference we will be working with
* define a set of species we are going to work on
* select skeletal region as a focus, e.g. the gill arch region, or tail fin
* look at what has already been annotated for this region, as a character-by-taxon matrix
** expect several hundred taxa, and between 50 and 200 characters, depending on how feature-rich the region is
** a source paper may not give the character at the species level, so the taxon may be a higher-level taxon 
* if characters are already present, just add the reference
* otherwise define new character
** choose existing entity term, initially this will be an anatomy term; term may not exist yet in which case we need to work with a provisional term
** choose attribute term from PATO; term may not exist yet in which case we need to work with a provisional term
** denote original character description, with reference (which will probably be the paper we are working with)
* edit/view character: will see the images that have been used for the different states (values) that have been assigned 
* assign/edit character states using a table with only the set of species chosen earlier, and one or more characters that correspond to the original character definition
** denote original character state description, with reference (which will probably be the paper we are working with)

* Taxonomic naming challenges: need to map original names to current classification; should never have two distinct rows for what is currently considered (as defined by the taxonomic ontology) the same species

===Database requirements===

* Need to have references to digital information, such as specimen record and image
