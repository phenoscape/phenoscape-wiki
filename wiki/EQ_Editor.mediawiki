=EQ Editor requirements=

The EQ Editor will be used by curators to annotate phenotypic descriptions of Ostariophysi using EQ syntax and ontologies.

The curator will use the EQ Editor to code phenotypic data from an existing publication into the EQ format.  This data consists of descriptions of character state values for corresponding species.  Each species will be represented by values for multiple different characters.  A published character state description may contain: the species or higher taxonomic specification, a textual description of the character state value, reference to a voucher specimen for this description, an image showing the character.  The character state may be a value for a separately defined character, which may have its own descriptive text in the publication (especially if the data is in in a species-by-character matrix).

===Workflow===

The publication being coded may contain data in one of a few different formats.  The given data format may suggest its own style of workflow.  These publication types include 3 main forms:

# A data matrix with multiple species and multiple characters.  There is a character state value for each cell in this matrix.
#A single species description of values for many characters.
# Description of a single character for many species (perhaps less common than the other two formats?).  If focusing on a single character the data may come from multiple publications.

It seems like scenarios 2 and 3 can be treated as special cases of scenario 1.  For each character, an interface is required for choosing the Entity and Quality from their respective ontologies, and entering free text such as the original character descriptions.

Since many species will share common values of character states, the interface should have a way of choosing previously entered character states, perhaps by separately enumerating the possible values for a character.  It is not clear whether EQ coding should be performed for characters as well as character states - see "EQ for character matrices".

At the [[WG:PI_Meeting_26feb07|February 2007 PI meeting]], some features of the workflow were discussed which may be most useful when the central database of character states is in place, such as:
* see what is already present about a particular character or "similar" characters (based on related entities or qualities)
* see what values have been previously assigned for a character (from other publications)
* view conflicting character states from different publications, choose to keep both or reconcile

One possible workflow would be a curator dealing with a single publication during a session of working with the EQ Editor.  Steps might be:

# Create a new EQ Editor document.
# Enter document-wide data, such as publication information including author, title, journal, etc.
# Create a list of taxa which are described in the publication.  If a taxonomic ontology is available, the taxa could be chosen from the ontology; otherwise, simply entered as free text (are other forms of identifier available for fish species?)
# Create a list of characters described in the publication.  For each character, choose an Entity from the anatomy ontology and a Quality from PATO.  If the Quality is a relational quality, choose another Entity to which it refers.  Because this is a character, the quality should be an Attribute, not a Value.  For each character, the curator can also add free text containing the original character title and notes.
# After taxa and characters have been defined, the curator can begin annotating character states for each character for each species.  For each character state, the curator will choose a value from a list of the Value descendants in PATO of the Attribute specified in the character.  The curator can also add free text containing the original character state title and notes.  Each character state can also be annotated with an image URL and a voucher specimen ID.
