title: Entities with taxonomic context

Our phenotype annotations currently employ linking a phenotype composition to a taxon via an ''exhibits'' relation.  However this model has not provided an obvious way to employ taxon-specific homology annotations to the anatomical entities being annotated.  This page describes an alternative representation of phenotype annotations which seems to provide a solution for employing homology annotations as well as anatomical relations which are taxon-specific.

==Phenotype annotations==
===Old form===
Our current phenotype annotation model has the form "a particular taxon has some phenotype, consisting of some quality inhering in some anatomical entity":
 Danio rerio ''exhibits'' sigmoid^''inheres_in''(vertebra 1)
The phenotype is a post-composition with the following properties:
 sigmoid^''inheres_in''(vertebra 1) ''is_a'' sigmoid
 sigmoid^''inheres_in''(vertebra 1) ''inheres_in'' vertebra 1
===New form===
This annotation can be stated differently as "some anatomical entity, in a particular taxon, has some quality":
 vertebra 1^''in_taxon''(Danio rerio) ''has_quality'' sigmoid
The entity is a post-composition with the following properties:
 vertebra 1^''in_taxon''(Danio rerio) ''is_a'' vertebra 1
 vertebra 1^''in_taxon''(Danio rerio) ''in_taxon'' Danio rerio
Taking into account the contents of the TAO and TTO ontologies, we can infer useful statements such as:
 vertebra 1^''in_taxon''(Danio rerio) ''is_a'' vertebra 1^''in_taxon''(Cyprinidae)
 vertebra 1^''in_taxon''(Danio rerio) ''is_a'' bone

==Taxonomically variable ontology relationships==
Using these entity post-compositions, we can assert taxon-specific anatomical relationships such as:
 vertebra 1^''in_taxon''(Cyprinidae) ''part_of'' Weberian apparatus
Now if we search for phenotype annotations in which the subject entity is part_of the Weberian apparatus, we will find the one about vertebra 1 of Danio rerio:
 vertebra 1^''in_taxon''(Danio rerio) ''has_quality'' sigmoid
However, we would correctly not find an annotation about vertebra 1 in Chanos chanos, which is not in Cyprinidae:
 vertebra 1^''in_taxon''(Chanos chanos) ''has_quality'' serrated
Searching for phenotype annotations in which the subject entity is vertebra 1 would return both statements.

==Homology annotations==
