title: Entities with taxonomic context

Our phenotype annotations currently employ linking a phenotype composition to a taxon via an ''exhibits'' relation.  However this model has not provided an obvious way to employ taxon-specific homology annotations to the anatomical entities being annotated.  This page describes an alternative representation of phenotype annotations which seems to provide a solution for employing homology annotations as well as anatomical relations which are taxon-specific.

==Phenotype annotations==
Our current phenotype annotation model has the form "a particular taxon has some phenotype, consisting of some quality inhering in some anatomical entity":
 Danio rerio ''exhibits'' sigmoid^''inheres_in''(vertebra 1)
The phenotype is a post-composition with the following properties:
 sigmoid^''inheres_in''(vertebra 1) ''is_a'' sigmoid
 sigmoid^''inheres_in''(vertebra 1) ''inheres_in'' vertebra 1
This annotation can be stated differently as "some anatomical entity, in a particular taxon, has some quality":
 vertebra 1^''in_taxon''(Danio rerio) ''has_quality'' sigmoid
The entity is a post-composition with the following properties:
 vertebra 1^''in_taxon''(Danio rerio) ''is_a'' vertebra 1
 vertebra 1^''in_taxon''(Danio rerio) ''in_taxon'' Danio rerio
Taking into account the contents of the TAO and TTO ontologies, we can infer useful statements such as:
 vertebra 1^''in_taxon''(Danio rerio) ''is_a'' vertebra 1^''in_taxon''(Cyprinidae)
 vertebra 1^''in_taxon''(Danio rerio) ''is_a'' bone
 vertebra^in_taxon(Cyprinidae) has_quality sigmoid
 bone^in_taxon(Cyprinidae) has_quality shape
