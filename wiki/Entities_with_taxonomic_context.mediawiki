title: Entities with taxonomic context
---

Our phenotype annotations currently employ linking a phenotype composition to a taxon via an ''exhibits'' relation.  However this model has not provided an obvious way to employ taxon-specific homology annotations to the anatomical entities being annotated.  This page describes an alternative representation of phenotype annotations which seems to provide a solution for employing homology annotations as well as anatomical relations which are taxon-specific.

==Phenotype annotations==
Our current phenotype annotation model has the form "a taxon has some phenotype":
 '''Danio rerio''' '''''exhibits''''' '''sigmoid^''inheres_in''(vertebra 1)'''

==Taxonomically variable ontology relationships==

==Homology annotations==
