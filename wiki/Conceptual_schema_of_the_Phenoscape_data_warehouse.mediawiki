'''Description of the data warehouse conceptual schema '''

NOTE: This is a phenotype-centric model of the data warehouse. 

A SUBJECT may exhibit one or more PHENOTYPE(s). A PHENOTYPE may be exhibited by one or more SUBJECT(s). A SUBJECT may be a specialized type of zero or more SUBJECT(s). For every instance of an association between a SUBJECT and PHENOTYPE, descriptive attributes such as PUBLICATION, CHARACTER TEXT, STATE TEXT, CHARACTER COMMENT, and STATE COMMENT need to be captured.
