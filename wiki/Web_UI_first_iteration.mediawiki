title: Web UI first iteration
---

Specifications for an initial implementation of the Phenoscape web user interface.  Drawings of these interfaces can be found [[Web_UI_mockups|here]].

==Entry page==
Start with 4 search entry points:
* Anatomy
* Taxonomy
* Genes
* Publications

After clicking one of the entry points, the page dynamically displays a corresponding search interface.
===Anatomy===
[[Image:Web_search_anatomy.png|thumb|100px]]
* User is presented with a search field, which autocompletes terms from the anatomy ontology.
* As terms are highlighted in the autocomplete field, a term info panel displays metadata.
* Once an anatomy term has been selected, the user can press a Search button to retrieve a [[#Annotation summary page|summary of database results]] about that term.

===Taxonomy===
* User is presented with a search field, which autocompletes terms from the taxonomy ontology.
* As terms are highlighted in the autocomplete field, a term info panel displays metadata.
* Once a taxonomy term has been selected, the user can press a Search button to retrieve a [[#Taxonomy summary page|summary of database results]] about that term.

===Genes===

===Publications===

==Annotation summary page==
Summary is grouped into rows lumped by qualities.
*For each quality, there are 3 columns:
** n annotations in p taxa
** n annotations in p genes
** n annotations in p publications
*There is also a checkbox next to each row - the user can select rows, and view the annotations summary counts for the intersection of the selected rows.
* There are also buttons or links to view annotations for "All Taxa", "All Genes", or "All Pubs".
* All of these annotation count summaries are links to annotation list pages.

==Taxonomy summary page==
Summary is grouped by anatomy terms, and then qualities within.  Within each anatomy term grouping, the display is the same as the anatomy search results.
* The anatomy term "header" acts as a row in the table displaying the union of the results for the qualities within it.
