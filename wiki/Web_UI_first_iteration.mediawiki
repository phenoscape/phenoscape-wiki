Start with 4 search entry points:
* Anatomy
* Taxonomy
* Genes
* Publications

After clicking one of the entry points, the page dynamically displays a corresponding search interface.

* User is presented with a search field, which autocompletes terms from the anatomy ontology.
* As terms are highlighted in the autocomplete field, a term info panel displays metadata.
* Once an anatomy term has been selected, the user can press a Search button to retrieve a summary of database results about that term.
