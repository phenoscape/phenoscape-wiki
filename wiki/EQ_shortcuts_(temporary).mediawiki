title: EQ shortcuts (temporary)
---

Here are temporary curation shortcuts for creating particular kinds of phenotypes. These can be used until better EQ entry interfaces are available in Phenex.  The KB data loader will watch for and correctly interpret each of these.

==Complementary phenotypes ("negation")==
Example: "opercle, not round". Create a postcomposition for the quality, choosing a meaningful genus term and using the "not" relation.
* E: opercle
* Q: shape^not(round)

==Comparative phenotypes (one structure relative to another)==
Example: supraorbital increased in size relative to frontal<br>
