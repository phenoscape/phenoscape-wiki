title: Queries to be implemented in the future
---

This page discusses the requirements of the various data access modules of the Phenoscape application to be demonstrated at the ASIH workshop, and documents the performance of the various [[Queries#Proposed_querying_strategies_for_the_ASIH_prototype|querying strategies]] being tested for these modules.

= Anatomy data services =

Given a specific anatomical entity A, the requirements of the anatomy data service module are as follows:

# Identify ALL unique phenotypes {P} that are composed of the entity A or any of its subtypes.
# For each identified phenotype P which is of the form inheres_in(Q, E)
## Identify the quality Q. 
### In addition, identify the character C which subsumes Q. This requires navigating the PATO hierarchy recursively in some cases
## Identify the entity E. E may be the same as A, or any valid subtype of A.
## Identify the set of taxa {T} or genotypes {GT} that exhibit the phenotype P. 
### For a genotype GT, identify the gene G that encodes it.

The result should be a list in the format shown below

<javascript>
<Search-Anatomical-Entity>         <Phenotype>             <Entity>         <Quality>    <Character>      <List of taxa>OR<List of genes>
</javascript>


==Strategy #1==

This strategy is the [[Strategy_#1:_Simple_table_joins|simplest way]] to try and get all the necessary information related to the anatomical entity being searched for. Below is the actual query which attempts to do this. This query returns the unique phenotypes associated with the anatomical entity, and the qualities and specific anatomical entities associated with the phenotype, as well as the list of taxa that exhibit each of these phenotypes in one fell table join (uh, swoop).
