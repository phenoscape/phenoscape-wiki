title: Term Requests
---

The ontologies developed by Phenoscape are updated regularly, and requests from the community for improvement to the ontologies are welcome.  These requests are typically for addition of new terms and synonyms, new and refined definitions and relationships, and corrections for spelling errors. Requests are submitted to one of the SourceForge trackers, and automatically forwarded to the teleost-discuss mailing list so that other users can provide feedback on the request. Below is a flowchart showing the term request process for the anatomy ontology (TAO):

===Create Your SourceForge Account===
Go to the [http://sourceforge.net/ SourceForge homepage] to create your account (click on the "create account" link on the upper right corner of the page). Although requests can be submitted without logging in, creating your own account has the advantage of allowing you to track the progress of your request by email and through your sourceforge account page.

# Log on to your [http://sourceforge.net/ SourceForge] account
# Go to the tracker page approporiate for your request: [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=76834&atid=994764 teleost anatomy tracker] or [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=1046550&group_id=76834&func=browse taxonomy tracker]. Once you have submitted your first request, you can also navigate to the tracker page by clicking on the "Tracker" link within your Personal Page.
