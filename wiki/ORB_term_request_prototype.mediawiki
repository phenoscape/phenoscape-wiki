title: ORB term request prototype
---

== Introduction ==

The vision of this project is to develop an application that will allow data curators to use new ontology terms without creating a workflow bottleneck.

=== Background ===
There is a need for applications that will expedite the annotation of phenotypic characters using ontologies and also promote community participation in the expansion and refinement of ontologies.  One particular need that has arisen within Phenoscape and other projects is for an Ontology Request Broker (ORB), an application that can launch new ontology term requests within existing data curation workflows, record term provenance and community discussion, enable temporary terms to be used in data annotation, and update temporary terms once a request has been resolved.

=== Scope ===

Here is a documentation of ORB term request service. ORB will be accessible via an online interface and programmatically through RESTful web-services.

=== ORB architecture overview ===

==Use cases==


'''Case:Place a term request within an ontology annotation application''' <br />

Brief: One of the key challenges in ontological data annotation is placing a new term request.During annotation, a user normally has to switch from his/her annotation platform/application ( for example[https://www.phenoscape.org/wiki/Phenex Phenex]) to a different URL (such as sourceforge based term tracker) to place a request. This poses a bottleneck to efficient data annotation especially in large-scale projects.
An annotator working with an annotation application integrating ORB's submit term request service, can submit a new request and receive a temporary ID to work with before the requested term is assigned an official ontology ID.

Actor: annotator of data using ontology terms

Pre-condition:
-The antology annotation application being used is integrated to ORB's submit term request service

Ideal path
The process is initiated when the user initiates new term request within the annotation application
# A GUI for term submission is generated
# User completes the term submission fields
#User clicks on the submit button
# ORB validates the request
# ORB informs the user of successful term submission and provides a temporary ID(referred to as ORB ID) assigned to the term
# Adds the new request to the database

Invalid path : This occurs when the user submits an invalid request
#ORB alerts the user that the request is invalid
#ORB return the term submission GUI with the invalid field(s) highlighted

----

'''Case:Get term from the ontology annotation application''' <br />

Brief: After placing a term request, a ontology annotator would like to find out if the term has been resolved (i.e assigned the correct name and ontology ID).

Actor: ontology annotator

Pre-condition
-The antology annotation application being used is integrated to ORB's get term via orb ID service.
Ideal path
The process is initiated when the user initiates get term via ORB ID within the annotation application
# A GUI for inserting the ORB ID is generated
# User inserts the ID
#User clicks on the submit button
# ORB validates the request
# ORB informs user that the term has been resolved and returns the resolved term's name, ontology ID, definition plus other related information 

Alternative paths:

If the term is still pending
#ORB informs the user that the term is still pending and  returns the term's name, ORB ID plus any other updates relating to the term

If the term is obsoleted
#ORB informs user that the term has been obsoleted and returns the suggested correct ontology term if one exists
#ORB also returns any comments that may give a clue to the user why the term was obsoleted

If a term matching the ORB ID is not found
#ORB informs user that no match was found
#ORB suggests to the user to verify if the ORB ID provided was correct an if he/she wants to re-submit another ORB ID




----
'''Case:Register''' <br />
Brief: This is a use case for creating an account in ORB

Actor:ORB user

Pre-condition: The user is at the ORB site

Ideal path
The process is initiated when the user selects the registration link
# ORB presents the registration page
# User provides required fields(e-mail,name, password and country)
# User submits his/her information
# ORB verifies the request
# ORB informs the user of successful registration and provides an activation link
# ORB sends the registration information to the user's e-mail account


Alternative path
Invalid request: This occurs when a user submits a request with missing required information
#The steps 1 to 4 in the ideal path apply
# ORB terminates the registration
# ORB returns to the registration page with the missing field highlighted

Invalid e-mail address: This occurs when a user provides an invalid e-mail address
# The steps 1 to 4 in the ideal path apply
# ORB terminates the registration
# ORB informs user the e-mail address is invalid
# ORB returns the registration page




----
'''Case:SubmitTerm'''

Brief: This is a use case  for submitting new ontology term requests.

Actor: TermRequester

Pre-conditions: The requester must be at the ORB website and has an account

Ideal path:
# This use case is initiated when the requester clicks on the term submission tab
# ORB presents the user login page for the requester to fill in the name and password
# ORB verifies the requester
# ORB displays the term submission page
# Requester provides the required fields(i.e term's name, parent, textual definition,target ontology) plus any additional information related to the term (i.e other relations, references, database cross references, comments etc) and submits
# ORB verifies the submission
# ORB assigns a temporary ID to the term and presents it the requester
# ORB sends the requested term's temporary ID and other details to requester's e-mail account
# ORB returns to the term submission page

Alternative paths:

Invalid request: This occurs if the user submits a request without the required fields
# Steps 1 to 6 as described in the ideal path will apply
# ORB will the terminate the request
# ORB will return to the term submission page with the missing required field highlighted

Matching term found: This occurs when the requested term already exists in the targetted ontology
# Steps 1 to 6 as described in the ideal path will apply
#ORB returns a message informing the requester that the term exists
# ORB returns the matching term's id, name and parent to the requester

Dilator muscles of the pharynx also attach to the alar plates. Operation of the anterior pharyngeal valve is accomplished by the contractionof the dilator muscles inserted on the wing-like alae, thereby raising or lowering the v-shaped wedge. When the wedge is raised,fluid is taken up, when lowered, it projects down into the v-shaped valve, sealing it and prevents backflow.</definition_text>

'''Minutes'''
**ORB will be accessible via browsers and programmatically as REST web services.
**Term requester and Ontology gatekeepers must create an account at the site.
**A function to allow for submission of a term to multiple ontologies would useful.
**Apart from term submission, definition revision, term obsoletion and graph placement should be implemented.
**The users are categorized as:requester, ontology gatekeeper,developers, casual user and the community at large. A casual user need not register at the site.Visit [https://www.phenoscape.org/wiki/ORB_term_request_prototype#Requirements requirements] section for details on each of the users' role(s).
**Function for uploading a file and downloading terms to be implemented
**Have a section within ORB site for updates on latest acivities
**Integrate ORB into phenex
**Host the ORB project at sourceforge on it's page
**Have a mechanism of checking if a term already exists in an ontology
**Communication via e-mail
**ORB meetings after each use case implementation
**Code will be shared via subversion repository for team review

*Action items
**Contact the Berkley group (BBPO) on ORB trial
**Have screen shots of ORB uploaded in the wiki to demonstrate functionality
