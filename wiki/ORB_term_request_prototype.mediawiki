title: ORB term request prototype
---

== Introduction ==

The vision of this project is to develop an application that will allow data curators to use new ontology terms without creating a workflow bottleneck.

=== Background ===
There is a need for applications that will expedite the annotation of phenotypic characters using ontologies and also promote community participation in the expansion and refinement of ontologies.  One particular need that has arisen within Phenoscape and other projects is for an Ontology Request Broker (ORB), an application that can launch new ontology term requests within existing data curation workflows, record term provenance and community discussion, enable temporary terms to be used in data annotation, and update temporary terms once a request has been resolved.

=== Scope ===

Here is a documentation of ORB term request service. ORB will be accessible via an online interface and programmatically through RESTful web-services.

=== ORB architecture overview ===

== Requirements ==

'''Accessibility'''
*ORB will have a web interface for easy access via browsers
*It will also have REST-style web service for programmatic access. The prototype will be integrated into [https://www.phenoscape.org/wiki/Phenex Phenex] as a demonstration

'''Actors and roles'''

* Requester
**Has an account or  registers at the site
**Submits a term request
**Can edit their own (specific) requested terms; name, definition, parent, relations, references, cross-references, synonyms and add comments.

* Ontology gatekeeper
**Has an account or registers if it’s the first time visiting ORB
**Can edit all the requested term’s fields
**The only one with privileges to change a term’s status

* Developers
**Have access to the source code and an exposed API for integrating and developing ORB

* Casual user
**May or may not have an account at the site
**Can browse , search, download and  comment on terms

* Community
**Report bugs
**Submit feature requests
**Participate in term focused discussions

'''ORB prototype functions'''

'''Required'''
**New term request:
**Verifies if the requester is registered. If not, generates the registration form else, the login page for requester to login
**On successful registration(first time users) or login(for registered users), generates the term submission form
**Validates if all the required term fields are provided
**Validates if the e-mail provided is valid
**Validates if the requested term already exists in the ontology to which it's to be added
*If the request is valid:
** Assign's a temporary ID, status and generates date of submission to the term
**Informs the requester of successful submission
** Sends the term's temporary ID plus the details to the requester's e-mail account
**Persists the requested term to the ORB database
**Generates an update at the latest activity section of the site
*If the request is invalid because of missing fields or inauthentic e-mail address, ORB rejects the request and sends a message to the requester about the failed submission and the reason
*If the request is invalid because the term already exists in the ontology, ORB informs the requester about the failed submission and returns the matching term from the ontology with the permanent ID assigned to it.

**Term editing
*Validates if the user is a registered ontology gatekeeper for the specific ontology or the requester of the specific term
*Generates a term's editable fields
*Saves the terms altered or added information
*Sends a notification to the term's requester and ontology gatekeeper
*Generates an update about the action at the site's latest activity section

**Term's status change
*Verifies if the user is the authentic ontology gatekeeper for the specific ontology
*If the valid gatekeeper, generates term's page with the editable feature
*if status is set to 'resolved', a pop up field is generated for inserting the term's permanent ID
*Saves the terms edited information to the database
*Sends a notification message  to the term requester's e-mail account
*Generates an update about the edited term at the latest activity section

'''May be implemented in the prototype'''
**Validation of the submitted term's text definition
**Validation of the term's relations if matching those specified in the ontology
**Auto-completion services for relations,ontology name,parent and synonyms during term request and also in the term searching fields
**Enable a term request submission to multiple ontologies


'''Support'''

**A comprehensive documentation on ORB's functions(how to..),implementation and help pages
**Registration, accurate and extensive documentation at [http://sourceforge.net/ sourceforge], [http://www.biocatalogue.org/ Biocatalogue] and [https://www.phenoscape.org/wiki/Main_Page Phenoscape wiki]
**Bug tracking and feature request mechanism








Note: The roles of casual users also apply to developers, requester and ontology gatekeepers
