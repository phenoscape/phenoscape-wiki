title: ORB term request prototype
---

== Introduction ==

The vision of this project is to develop an application that will allow data curators to use new ontology terms without creating a workflow bottleneck.

=== Background ===
There is a need for applications that will expedite the annotation of phenotypic characters using ontologies and also promote community participation in the expansion and refinement of ontologies.  One particular need that has arisen within Phenoscape and other projects is for an Ontology Request Broker (ORB), an application that can launch new ontology term requests within existing data curation workflows, record term provenance and community discussion, enable temporary terms to be used in data annotation, and update temporary terms once a request has been resolved.

=== Scope ===

Here is a documentation of ORB term request service. ORB will be accessible via an online interface and programmatically through RESTful web-services.

''An agile approach is used in ORB development. The sign √ indicates accomplished tasks while * indicates tasks yet to be implemented''

'''Week 1: 4 to 9 January, 2010'''
To review the ORB project, suggest any changes in light of existing technologies from literature review and input from the team and document the (including the changes).
*Revise the ORB project plan and milestones√
*Identify a suitable citation management tool and learn how to utilize it√
*Perform a comprehensive literature search and read the relevant papers and add to the ORB literature review√


'''Week 2: 10 to 16 January, 2010'''
Complete literature review, document and discuss with project team
*Perform further literature search, read and complete literature review*
*Document the project requirements (technologies to be used, architecture, behavior) in the project wiki*
*Hold an online meeting with NESCent team about progress and ORB implementation based on literature review and existing technologies√

'''Agenda'''

**ORB requirements
**Working modalities
*

'''Minutes'''
**ORB will be accessible via browsers and programmatically as REST web services
**Term requester and Ontology gatekeepers must create an account at the site
**A function to allow for submission of a term to multiple ontologies would useful
**Apart from term submission, definition revision, term obsoletion and graph placement  should be implemented
**A casual user need not register at the site
**Function for uploading a file and downloading terms to be implemented
**Have a section within ORB site for updates on latest acivities
**Integrate ORB into phenex
**Host the ORB project at sourceforge on it's page
**Have a mechanism of checking if a term already exists in an ontology
**Communication via e-mail
**ORB meetings after each use case implementation
**Code will be shared via subversion repository for team review

*Action items
**Contact the Berkley group(BBPO) on ORB trial
**Have screen shots of ORB uploaded in the wiki to demonstrate functionality
