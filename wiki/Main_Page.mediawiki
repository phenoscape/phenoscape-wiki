| This project was funded by NSF grant BDI<nowiki>-</nowiki>0641025 from June 1, 2007, to Jun 30, 2011, and was supported by the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NESCent), NSF #EF-0423641. The [[Phenoscape I| project home page has been archived]] on this wiki. The project arose from a NESCent <span class="plainlinks">[http://www.nescent.org/science/workinggroup.php Working Group]</span> led by Paula Mabee and Monte Westerfield, "Towards an Integrated Database for Fish Evolution." [[Fish Evolution Working Group|Goals and summaries of the group]] are archived on this wiki.
