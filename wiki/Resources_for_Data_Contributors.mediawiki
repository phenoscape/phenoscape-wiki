The following instructions outline the resources used by Phenoscape curators for the annotation of evolutionary phenotypes.  If you are a student intern, please refer to the [http://phenoscape.org/wiki/Student_Instructions Student Instructions] page for more information and links.

==1. Download Most Recent Version of Phenex==

Phenex was developed by Phenoscape for annotation of evolutionary phenotypes.  You can find instructions for downloading and installing Phenex at the [[Phenex|'''Phenex homepage''']].

==2. Access Project Files==

Phenoscape project files are XML files (more specifically, they are in [http://nexml.org NeXML] format) created using Phenex and available on GitHub at https://github.com/phenoscape/phenoscape-data.

==3. Access PDFs for Curation ==

Phenoscape maintains a collection of PDFs for curation. Please ask project personnel (Wasila or Paula) for access to the collection.

==4. Use Ontologies to Annotate Characters ==

The primary activity of a curator is to annotate the free-text characters from systematic studies using ontologies.  Instructions for this activity can be found in the [[Guide to Character Annotation | '''Phenoscape Guide to Character Annotation''']].

==5. Update Taxon Lists==

Most project files require a taxonomic expert to review the taxonomy used in a publication and update to reflect current taxonomy. Please see instructions for [[Creating Taxon Lists| '''creating taxon lists''']] in Phenex or instructions for [[Update Taxon Lists| '''updating taxon lists''']] with valid taxon names.

==6. Request New Terms for Ontologies==

Curation drives ontology development and many new terms and relationships need to be added. Submit requests for updates to the ontologies used in Phenoscape to the following term trackers:

* [https://github.com/cmungall/uberon/issues Uber Anatomy Ontology (Uberon) term tracker]
* [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=76834&atid=595654 Phenotype and Trait Ontology (PATO) term tracker]
* [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=224046&atid=2519810 Vertebrate Taxonomy Ontology (VTO) term tracker]
* [http://phenoscape.org/wiki/Ontologies#Fish_Collection_Codes_Vocabulary Collection Codes Vocabulary]

==7. Edit the Anatomy Ontology ==
* [http://phenoscape.org/wiki/Ontology_workflow Ontology Editing Guidelines]

==8. Subscribe to Curator and Ontology Request Mailing Lists ==
* Discussion of ontology development and Open Biomedical Ontologies community issues  ''[https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/obo-discuss obo-discuss]
