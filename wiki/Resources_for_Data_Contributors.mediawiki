The following instructions outline the resources used by Phenoscape curators for the annotation of evolutionary phenotypes.  If you are a student intern, please refer to the [http://phenoscape.org/wiki/Student_Instructions Student Instructions] page for more information and links.

==1. Download Most Recent Version of Phenex==

Phenex was developed by Phenoscape for annotation of evolutionary phenotypes.  You can find instructions for downloading and installing Phenex at the [[Phenex|'''Phenex homepage''']].

==2. Access Project Files==

Phenoscape project files are XML files (more specifically, they are in [http://nexml.org NeXML] format) created using Phenex and housed in a shared [http://www.dropbox.com DropBox] folder (named 'Phenoscape-data').  Please contact Wasila or Paula if you are interested in perusing or adding to them.

==3. Access PDFs for Curation ==

Phenoscape uses [http://www.mendeley.com/ Mendeley] to maintain the collection of PDFs for curation. Please ask project personnel (Wasila or Paula) for an invitation to join the group.

Phenoscape also maintains a collection of PDFs for teleost publications on the Phenoscape file share. Directions for connecting to the file share are below.  Please ask a Phenoscaper for the username and password.

====Mac OS X====
# In finder > Go > Connect to Server
# Type in
<nowiki>https://webdav.nescent.org/phenoscape-data</nowiki> 
# Accept security warning about certificate
# enter username and password

====Windows XP====
# Go to "My Network Places"
# Add a Network Place (pulls up wizard)
# Click Next twice
# In internet or Network address box, type in
<nowiki>https://webdav.nescent.org/phenoscape-data</nowiki> 
# Accept certificate warning, if given.
# Give the share a meaningful name. Default is usually fine.
# Finish

==4. Use Ontologies to Annotate Characters ==

The primary activity of a curator is to annotate the free-text characters from systematic studies using ontologies.  Instructions for this activity can be found in the [[Guide to Character Annotation | '''Phenoscape Guide to Character Annotation''']].

==5. Update Taxon Lists==

Most project files require a taxonomic expert to review the taxonomy used in a publication and update to reflect current taxonomy. Please see instructions for [[Creating Taxon Lists| '''creating taxon lists''']] in Phenex or instructions for [[Update Taxon Lists| '''updating taxon lists''']].

==6. Request New Terms for Ontologies==

Curation drives ontology development and many new terms and relationships need to be added. Term requests for updates to ontologies used in Phenoscape can be submitted to the following term trackers:

* [https://github.com/cmungall/uberon/issues Uber Anatomy Ontology (Uberon) term tracker]
* [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=76834&atid=595654 Phenotype and Trait Ontology (PATO) term tracker]
* [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=224046&atid=2519810 Vertebrate Taxonomy Ontology (VTO) term tracker]
* [http://phenoscape.org/wiki/Ontologies#Fish_Collection_Codes_Vocabulary Collection Codes Vocabulary]

==7. Edit the Anatomy Ontology ==
* [http://phenoscape.org/wiki/Ontology_workflow Ontology Editing Guidelines]

==8. Subscribe to Curator and Ontology Request Mailing Lists ==
* Phenoscape Curators mailing list (for discussion and communication of data curation issues, solutions, and progress):  [http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/phenoscape-curators phenoscape-curators]
* Discussion of EQ formalism, phenotype description, PATO terms:  ''[https://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/obo-phenotype obo-phenotype]
* Discussion of anatomy ontology issues ''[https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/obo-anatomy obo-anatomy]
