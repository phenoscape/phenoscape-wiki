==Viewing ontologies==

===On the web===

Many ontologies are available for browsing at the [http://www.bioontology.org/ncbo/faces/index.xhtml NCBO BioPortal].  For example:
* [http://www.bioontology.org/ncbo/faces/pages/ontology_details.xhtml?ontology_display_name=Zebrafish%20anatomy%20and%20development Zebrafish anatomy and development]
* [http://www.bioontology.org/ncbo/faces/pages/ontology_details.xhtml?ontology_display_name=PATO PATO]
Click the "Visualize" button on the ontology's homepage to browse it graphically.

Other ontologies:
* [http://www.obofoundry.org/ro/ OBO-relations]

The [[taxonomy ontology]] is now available:

* [http://www.bioontology.org/ncbo/faces/pages/ontology_details.xhtml?ontology_display_name=Teleost%20taxonomy Teleost taxonomy]
It is generated, with some modifications, from: [http://www.calacademy.org/RESEARCH/ichthyology/catalog/fishcatsearch.html Catalog of Fishes].

===On your desktop===

You can download the ontologies as OBO files from the above web sites.  You can download and install [http://oboedit.org/ OBO-Edit] to view in a desktop application.

==Annotating phenotypes==

===Genus-differentia definitions===

Term definitions in the teleost anatomy ontology (TAO) take the form of genus-differentia definitions: 

B is an A that has X.

The term (B) is defined by its membership in higher category (A) and distinguished by characteristics (X). The following are examples of genus-differentia definitions in the TAO:

1. The antorbital is a dermal bone that is located on the anterior margin of the infraorbital series, dorsal to the first infraorbital and lateral to the nasal bone. 

2. The dentary is a dermal bone that forms the anterolateral part of the lower jaw.

In example 1, the definition mentions the parent dermal bone of the term antorbital followed by the characteristics that differentiate antorbital from all other dermal bones.

[http://wiki.geneontology.org/index.php/Logical_Definitions Logical definitions] (also known as cross-products) are constructed as the intersection between terms and are genus-differentia definitions.

===Phenote===

[http://www.phenote.org/ Phenote] is used by ZFIN and FlyBase for mutant phenotype annotation.  We are developing enhancements to the Phenote [[EQ Editor]] for PhenoScape data curation.  Some of the PhenoScape-specific enhancements include:

* [[Phenote:Specimen List|A specimen list window]] allowing repeated annotation of the specimens within one publication.
* [[Phenote:Phylogeny Chooser|A phylogeny view]] allowing application of an EQ annotation to all specimens from a clade at once.

====Installation and start up====

* You need Java 1.5 or newer to run Phenote.  For the Mac this requires Mac OS X 10.4 or newer.
* Launch Phenote using the [http://www.phenote.org/phenote/latest/phenote.jnlp webstart link].  Alternatively, you can try the in-progress builds with the latest features, packaged for [https://www.nescent.org/wg/phenoscape/images/4/40/Phenote-MacOSX.zip Mac OS X] or [https://www.nescent.org/wg/phenoscape/images/d/db/Phenote-Windows.zip Windows].
* Choose the "phenomap" configuration before beginning (this will soon be replaced by a "phenoscape" config).
* So far most curators are using the Excel-compatible tab-delimited format for saving files.

====Usage====

The following table describes the entry fields in the PhenoScape configuration.  Phenote does not force you to fill in them all, but see the table for when to use each field.

{| border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3"
! Field
! Usage
|-
| Publication || the publication describing the character state
|-
| Taxon || Genus & species
|-
| Catalog Number || museum lot ID
|-
| Specimen Count || number of specimens from lot examined
|-
| Preparation || type of specimen preparation (skeleton, cleared & stained, etc.)
|-
| Entity || term from anatomy ontology (currently using zebrafish)
|-
| Quality || term from PATO - should be "value" term, unless you are filling in an absolute measurement (e.g. "length")
|-
| Additional Entity || term from anatomy ontology - only use if the Quality term descends from "relational quality of continuant"
|-
| Measurement || absolute measurement - useful as value for terms such as "length"
|-
| Unit || unit of measurement, if Numerical Value is filled in
|-
| Compare To || a taxon to which this phenotype is in comparison to (optional)
|-
| Textual Description || textual description of character state in publication
|-
| Image URI || web link to an image, if available
