==Viewing ontologies==

===On the web===

Many ontologies are available for browsing at the [http://www.bioontology.org/ncbo/faces/index.xhtml NCBO BioPortal].  For example:
* [http://www.bioontology.org/ncbo/faces/pages/ontology_details.xhtml?ontology_display_name=Zebrafish%20anatomy%20and%20development Zebrafish anatomy and development]
* [http://www.bioontology.org/ncbo/faces/pages/ontology_details.xhtml?ontology_display_name=PATO PATO]
Click the "Visualize" button on the ontology's homepage to browse it graphically.

The taxonomic ontology is not yet available, but it will be generated from the [http://www.calacademy.org/RESEARCH/ichthyology/catalog/fishcatsearch.html Catalog of Fishes].

===On your desktop===

You can download the ontologies as OBO files from the above web sites.  You can download and install [http://oboedit.org/ OBO-Edit] to view in a desktop application.

==Annotating phenotypes==

===PhenoMaP EQ Editor===

We are working on a specialized [[EQ Editor]] for data curation.  Until it is ready for use, EQ annotations can be created using Phenote.

===Phenote===

[http://www.phenote.org/ Phenote] is used by ZFIN and FlyBase for mutant phenotype annotation.
* Launch Phenote using the [http://www.phenote.org/phenote/latest/phenote.jnlp webstart link].
* You can download a customized [[Media:phenomap.cfg.zip|Phenote configuration file]] which is suited to our data.  See the [http://www.phenote.org/content/howtos/customize.shtml instructions] on how to use a custom configuration.
* Save your files using the PhenoSyntax file format.
