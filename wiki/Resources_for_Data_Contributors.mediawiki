==Viewing ontologies==

===On the web===

Many ontologies are available for browsing at the [http://www.bioontology.org/ncbo/faces/index.xhtml NCBO BioPortal].  For example:
* [http://www.bioontology.org/ncbo/faces/pages/ontology_details.xhtml?ontology_display_name=Zebrafish%20anatomy%20and%20development Zebrafish anatomy and development]
* [http://www.bioontology.org/ncbo/faces/pages/ontology_details.xhtml?ontology_display_name=PATO PATO]
Click the "Visualize" button on the ontology's homepage to browse it graphically.

Other ontologies:
* [http://www.obofoundry.org/ro/ OBO-relations]

The taxonomic ontology is not yet available, but it will be generated from the [http://www.calacademy.org/RESEARCH/ichthyology/catalog/fishcatsearch.html Catalog of Fishes].

===On your desktop===

You can download the ontologies as OBO files from the above web sites.  You can download and install [http://oboedit.org/ OBO-Edit] to view in a desktop application.

==Annotating phenotypes==

===PhenoMaP EQ Editor===

We are working on a specialized [[EQ Editor]] for data curation.  Until it is ready for use, EQ annotations can be created using Phenote.

===Phenote===

[http://www.phenote.org/ Phenote] is used by ZFIN and FlyBase for mutant phenotype annotation.

====Installation and start up====

* You need Java 1.5 or newer to run Phenote.  For the Mac this requires Mac OS X 10.4 or newer.
* Launch Phenote using the [http://www.phenote.org/phenote/latest/phenote.jnlp webstart link].
* You can download a customized [[Media:phenomap.cfg.zip|Phenote configuration file]] which is suited to our data.  See the [http://www.phenote.org/content/howtos/customize.shtml instructions] on how to use a custom configuration.
* If you are using a Mac, it can be tricky to access the Phenote configuration folder using the Finder - it begins with a "." and as a result is invisible.  To get to it while using the Finder, in the menubar select Go > Go to Folder..., then type "~/.phenote", and press the Go button.  You should then see the folder.
* Save your files using the PhenoSyntax file format (or perhaps the Excel-compatible tab-delimited format - not tested yet).

====Usage====

The following table describes the entry fields in the PhenoMap configuration.  Phenote does not force you to fill in them all, but see the table for when to use each field.

{| border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3"
! Field
! Usage
|-
| Publication || the publication describing the character state
|-
| Taxon || Genus & species
|-
| Specimen || museum lot ID
|-
| Entity || term from anatomy ontology (currently using zebrafish)
|-
| Quality || term from PATO - should be "value" term, unless you are filling in an absolute measurement (e.g. "length")
|-
| Add'l Entity || term from anatomy ontology - only use if the Quality term descends from "relational quality of continuant"
|-
| Numerical Value || absolute measurement - useful as value for terms such as "length"
|-
| Unit || unit of measurement, if Numerical Value is filled in
|-
| Original Description || textual description of character state in publication
|-
| Image URI || web link to an image, if available
|}
