The following instructions outline the resources used by Phenoscape curators for the annotation of evolutionary phenotypes.  If you are a student intern, please refer to the [http://phenoscape.org/wiki/Student_Instructions Student Instructions] page for more information and links.

==1. Download Most Recent Version of Phenex==

Phenex was developed by Phenoscape for annotation of evolutionary phenotypes.  You can find instructions for downloading and installing Phenex at the [[Phenex|'''Phenex homepage''']].

==2. Access Project Files==

Phenoscape project files are XML files (more specifically, they are in [http://nexml.org NeXML] format) created using Phenex and housed in a shared [http://www.dropbox.com DropBox] folder (named 'Phenoscape-data').  Please contact Wasila or Paula if you are interested in perusing or adding to them.

==3. Access PDFs for Curation ==

Phenoscape uses [http://www.mendeley.com/ Mendeley] to maintain the collection of PDFs for curation. Please ask project personnel (Wasila or Paula) for an invitation to join the group.

Phenoscape also maintains a collection of PDFs for teleost publications on the Phenoscape file share. Directions for connecting to the file share are below.  Please ask a Phenoscaper for the username and password.

====Mac OS X====
# In finder > Go > Connect to Server
# Type in <nowiki>https://webdav.nescent.org/phenoscape-data</nowiki>
# Accept security warning about certificate
# enter username and password

====Windows XP====
# Go to "My Network Places"
# Add a Network Place (pulls up wizard)
# Click Next twice
# In internet or Network address box, type in <nowiki>https://webdav.nescent.org/phenoscape-data</nowiki>
# Accept certificate warning, if given.
# Give the share a meaningful name. Default is usually fine.
# Finish

==4. Use Ontologies to Annotate Characters ==

The primary activity of a curator is to annotate the free-text characters from systematic studies using ontologies.  Instructions for this activity can be found in the [[Guide to Character Annotation | '''Phenoscape Guide to Character Annotation''']].

==5. Update Taxon Lists==

Most project files require a taxonomic expert to review the taxonomy used in a publication and update to reflect current taxonomy. Please see instructions for [[Update Taxon Lists| '''updating taxon lists''']].

==6. Request New Terms for Ontologies==

Curation drives ontology development and many new terms and relationships need to be added. For instructions on how to make these changes, please and see the [[Term_Requests | '''Term Request Instructions''']].
