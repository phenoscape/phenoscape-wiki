This page is an easily editable source for help popups in the Phenoscape web UI. Each entry below should be contained in a block element (DIV) with a mnemonic ID.



<div id="FindSpecificTerm" style="border: 2px dashed silver;">
===Find a Specific Term===

Use this tool to search using any valid term (taxon, gene, etc.) in the KnowledgeBase. '''You must choose a matched value from the drop-down list before you can search.'''
</div>


<div id="BrowseAllPhenotypes" style="border: 2px dashed silver;">
====Browse All Phenotypes====

You can browse all phenotypes. (This hint uses a smaller heading than ''Find a Specific Term''.)
</div>


<div id="BrowseTaxa" style="border: 2px dashed silver;">
This is a more compact style of hint that does not use a heading.

It should, however, have two paragraphs.
</div>
