### Taxonomic Scope

### Display qualities using a grid of colored tiles

- Qualities are displayed with consistent location and color in the grid
- Desaturated colors are used for qualities of phenotypes that are
  inferred, rather than annotated
  - Note annotation to Ictaluridae in this and next candidate example
- The 16 tile designs are intended to support expansion of the list of
  qualities used in curation - as has already happened.

### Display qualities using icons strung along branches

- Qualities are displayed with consistent icon, color and relative
  position along branches
- As above, desaturated colors are used for inferred qualities
- Additional icons may be added

## Version 0

### Display qualities using text icons adjacent to taxon names

- user enters any entity term
- each of the standard upper-level PATO qualities has some icon
- each node of tree is annotated with icons for which kinds of
  phenotypes are exhibited by that node
- so if you just put in "bone", you could get a "shape" icon at a node
  for any bone shape phenotype (basihyal bone round, vertebra 1 flat,
  etc.)
