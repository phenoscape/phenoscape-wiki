A workshop hosted by the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center
(NESCent).

## Location and Date

**Venue:** National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NESCent)
(<span class="plainlinks">[directions](http://www.nescent.org/about/directions.php)</span>,

visitors](http://www.nescent.org/about/information.php)</span>)

**Date:** September 17-18, 2007

**Organizers:** Paula Mabee, Monte Westerfield, Todd Vision, and Hilmar
Lapp

## Introduction

This workshop brings together scientists from the fields of morphology,
development, evolution, genetics, and ichthyology to define what
informatic tools need to exist in order to enable synthetic research
that takes full advantage of the accumulated data in each of these
fields. The workshop organizers are funded by NSF to develop a system
that provides web-based access to integrated evolutionary, anatomical,
developmental, and genetics data in the Ostariophysii, and to make the
software tools a community resource that can be more broadly applied.
Thus, a major goal of the workshop is to identify
<a href="Driving_Research_Questions" class="wikilink"
title="driving biological research questions">driving biological
research questions</a> that take advantage of these data to push the
limits of what is currently possible, and to identify what informatic
tools are needed in order to answer those questions. These will, in
turn, be distilled to Use Cases that drive the software development
activities at NESCent.
