==Reports on production Phenoscape KB==
This contains consistency-checked and author-checked files (from 'phenex-files').  It is updated irregularly (every 1-3 months). This contains all of the data files found [http://phenoscape.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/phenoscape/trunk/data/phenex-files/ here].  It contains the latest public versions of all ontologies at the time the data were loaded, with the exception of PATO (it currently contains an [http://www.duke.edu/~jpb15/quality.obo experimental PATO revision]), and TAO (it contains an experimental TAO incorporating the new VAO - this will be removed at the next update of this system).

==Reports on kb-staging==
kb-staging is currently offline for maintenance.  This will be where old tao (with no vao) will be running (so that Wasila and co. can test old tao against new tao (with vao, in kb-dev))

==Reports on kb-dev==
This database is used for active development and may often be broken. It should usually not be relied upon for everyday use (however as of Dec 17, 2010, it is the most up-to-date and stable system).

This contains all of the data files found [http://phenoscape.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/phenoscape/trunk/data/phenex-files/ here].  It contains the latest public versions of all ontologies at the time the data were loaded, with the exception of PATO (it currently contains an [http://www.duke.edu/~jpb15/quality.obo experimental PATO revision]).  It will have the tao with the vao ('new tao') for testing.
