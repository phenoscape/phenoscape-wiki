==Reports on production Phenoscape KB==
This contains consistency-checked and author-checked files (from 'phenex-files').  It is updated irregularly (every 1-3 months).

* [http://kb.phenoscape.org/OBD-WS/statistics/consistencyreports/relationalqualitieswithoutrelatedentities Relational qualities without related entities]
* [http://kb.phenoscape.org/OBD-WS/statistics/consistencyreports/nonrelationalqualitieswithrelatedentities Monadic qualities with related entities]
* [http://kb.phenoscape.org/OBD-WS/statistics/consistencyreports/characterswithonlyoneannotatedstate Characters with only one annotated state]
* [http://kb.phenoscape.org/OBD-WS/statistics/consistencyreports/characterswithonlyoneoftwopossibleannotations Presence/absence characters without both states]

==Reports on kb-staging==
This contains files that are going into production database (from 'phenex-files'); some are updated daily by curators. It is updated nightly.
* [http://kb-staging.phenoscape.org/OBD-WS/statistics/consistencyreports/relationalqualitieswithoutrelatedentities Relational qualities without related entities]

==Reports on kb-extra==
This database is equivalent to staging but also includes Sandrine's data files and all incomplete files ('incomplete-files' + 'phenex-files').  It is updated nightly.

==Reports on kb-dev==
This database is used for active development and may often be broken. It should not be relied upon for everyday use.

Currently, this database is equivalent to staging but also includes Sandrine's data files.
