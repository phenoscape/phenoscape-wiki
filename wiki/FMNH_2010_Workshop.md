In mid March Phenoscape met at the Biodiversity Synthesis Center
(BioSynC) at the Field Museum of Natural History (Chicago) to host an
education and outreach workshop, gather feedback on new user interface
mockups, and hold a project meeting. We sent the announcement below out
to the Chicago morphologists, systematists, and developmental
biologists. About 20 people attended our day-long meeting on Friday, and
they gave us very useful input that we have translated into new mockups
that are being developed for the Phenoscape KB.

'The Phenoscape group is developing informatics and tools for
integrating morphological data across studies and with genetic and
developmental data. The user interface and tools are being designed to
address the general needs of the systematics and ‘evo-devo’ community,
and we need your input. Come to learn about new methods that are
applicable to any group and to work hands-on with the knowledgebase
(kb.phenoscape.org).' We thank Mark Westneat and staff at the BioSynC
for their help in organizing this workshop as well as Lance Grande for
the superb behind-the-scenes tour.
