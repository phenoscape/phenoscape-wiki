title: TTOUpdate tool
---

== Overview<br/> ==

TTOUpdate is a tool used for merging updated exports from the [http://researcharchive.calacademy.org/research/Ichthyology/catalog/fishcatmain.asp Catalog of Fishes]. The exports are merged into a preexisting copy of the Teleost Taxonomy Ontology (cite) in OBO format.  

The source code for TTOUpdate is available [http://sourceforge.net/p/phenoscape/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/tools/TTOUpdate/ within the Phenoscape repository on Sourceforge] under the MIT license.

== Input Files ==

The export from the Catalog of Fishes (CoF) consists of 3 Excel 2003 files, consisting of species, genera, and higher level lineages respectively. Because the free text comments included in the CoF include comma, tab, and newline characters, csv and tab delimited text formats could not be used. The tool can also incorporate synonyms from multiple sources, including ITIS.

== Output ==

The output of TTOUpdate is an updated copy of the TTO in OBO (1.2) format.
