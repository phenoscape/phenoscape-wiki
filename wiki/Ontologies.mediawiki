title: Ontologies

Evolutionary phenotypes will be described using the [http://www.bioontology.org/wiki/index.php/PATO:About Entity-Quality system], which combines morphological terms from an anatomical ontology with quality terms from the [http://www.bioontology.org/wiki/index.php/PATO:Main_Page Phenotype and Trait Ontology (PATO)].

Phenotypes will be associated with taxa using a [taxonomy ontology] derived from the Catalog of Fishes.
