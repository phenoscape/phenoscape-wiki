title: Ontologies
---

Phenoscape is using multiple ontologies to describe variation in phenotypes across species.  We have developed several [[#New_Ontologies | new ontologies]] required for evolutionary biology, but whenever possible, we are sharing [[#Existing_Ontologies | existing ontologies]] with the broader biological community.  This will ensure the greatest interoperability between evolutionary and model organism data.

== Ontologies Initiated by Phenoscape ==

Phenoscape has developed ontologies that are required for the annotation of evolutionary phenotypes across species.  These ontologies are publicly available and being used and extended by the community [[Contributors|(view the list of contributors)]].

These ontologies will keep changing to accommodate our community needs, and they have been admitted into the OBO CVS-based version-control system, from where the NCBO's BioPortal loads and updates ontologies on a regular basis.  Ontologies available at the [http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ BioPortal] can be browsed, searched, and visualized. Ontologies are also available for download as .obo files from the [http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ BioPortal] or [http://www.obofoundry.org/ OBO Foundry], and viewed using the [http://oboedit.org/ OBO-Edit] desktop software.

== Anatomy Ontologies ==

Phenoscape is coordinating the integration of anatomy ontologies for vertebrates. Ontology update requests are made on the Vertebrate Anatomy term request tracker, and requests are forwarded to the vertebrate anatomy mailing list.  Links to the term request and mailing list subscription page are below:

* [https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=76834&atid=2257941 Vertebrate anatomy term request page] (requests are forwarded to the mailing list):

* Subscribe to the [https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/obo-vertebrate-anatomy vertebrate anatomy mailing list]

* Vertebrate anatomy list email: [mailto:obo-vertebrate-anatomy@lists.sourceforge.net obo-vertebrate-anatomy@lists.sourceforge.net]

[[WG:Anatomy_Ontology_Conf_calls | Notes from conference calls ]] for anatomy ontology coordination are maintained in the project intranet.

==== Teleost Anatomy Ontology ====

The [http://bioportal.bioontology.org/visualize/38362 Teleost Anatomy Ontology (TAO)] is a multi-species ontology that was initialized with terms from the Zebrafish Anatomical Ontology (ZFA). The development of the TAO currently focuses on the skeletal system because it varies significantly across fishes, is well-preserved in fossil specimens, and it is often the focus of morphologically-based evolutionary studies in ichthyology. Details about the development of the TAO can be found [[Teleost Anatomy Ontology | here]].

* Browse [http://bioportal.bioontology.org/visualize/38362 TAO at BioPortal]
* Download TAO from [http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/39222 Bioportal] or [http://www.obofoundry.org/ OBO Foundry] (use [http://oboedit.org/ OBO Edit] desktop software to open and view .obo file).

'''Next target release date: Late August 2011'''

* High-level skeletal terms from VAO will be imported into TAO with the next release

== Taxonomy Ontologies ==
=== Teleost Taxonomy Ontology ===

Phenotypes are associated with species using a taxonomy ontology, the [[Teleost Taxonomy Ontology]] (TTO) derived from the [http://www.calacademy.org/RESEARCH/ichthyology/catalog/fishcatsearch.html Catalog of Fishes] (see also the [http://bioportal.bioontology.org/visualize/38363 representation on BioPortal], which can be navigated on-line). The TTO is updated in concert with Catalog of Fishes updates.  Changes to the TTO relative to the latest version generated from a dump from the Catalog of Fishes are documented [[TTO_Changes]].

==== Taxonomic Rank Vocabulary ====
During 2010, we released a separate [[Taxonomic Rank Vocabulary]] (TAXRANK), and removed all rank terms (e.g., family, genus, etc.) from the taxa within the TTO.  Taxa in the TTO specify their ranks as property values via the metadata relation has_rank, but the object of the has_rank links is contained in the TAXRANK vocabulary.

Developing TAXRANK as a vocabulary, rather than an ontology (e.g., by defining an ordering relation between ranks) should facilitate its reuse in other taxonomic ontologies.  Developing a cross-authority (e.g., ICZN, ICBN, etc.) ontology of ranks may be possible, but there does not appear to be a compelling need for such an ontology.

* [[Documenting taxon concepts used in a publication]]
* [[Taxonomy ontology: ranks, unknown/unnamed species, & related issues]]
* [[Hypodigm|Ambiguous specimen information: annotating phenotypes for specimens or species]] (also called the Hypodigm problem)

* Browse [http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/38703 TTO at BioPortal]
* Download TTO from [http://bioportal.bioontology.org/visualize/38703 Bioportal] or [http://www.obofoundry.org/ OBO Foundry] (use [http://oboedit.org/ OBO Edit] desktop software to open and view .obo file).

=== Fish Collection Codes Ontology ===

There is a vocabulary of fish collections, based on [http://research.calacademy.org/research/ichthyology/catalog/abtabr.html a list used in Catalog of Fishes], though with a few additions listed on the [[Fish Collection Updates]] page.  It has been augmented with links to entries in the [http://biodiversitycollectionsindex.org/static/index.html Biodiversity Collections Index].

The current release, as used in Phenex is

== Shared Ontologies ==

These ontologies listed below were initiated by the model organism communities. Phenoscape is actively involved in extending these ontologies.

=== Phenotype and Trait Ontology ===

=== Evidence Code Ontology ===

=== Relations Ontology ===
* [http://www.obofoundry.org/ro/ OBO-relations]

=== Spatial Ontology ===
