==Development Plan==

===September 2007===

* Phenote: Search field for character list tables.  Filter out table rows by simple text matching.
* Phenote: Ontology mode for search field.  Show only rows using a term descending from the search term.
* Phenote: Character matrix view of entered data.  Read-only.

===October 2007===
* Phenote: Improved document opening/saving functionality.
** User will be able to quickly save a document to the same file it was opened from.
** User will be able to open multiple documents simultaneously.
* Phenote: Editable character matrix for data entry as well as viewing.

===November 2007===
* Phenote: Annotation using temporary terms, when an appropriate term is not available in an ontology.  Ability to update these terms to official term once it is available.
* Phenote: Should be feature-complete for essential character annotation work by curators.

===Early 2008===
* TBD
