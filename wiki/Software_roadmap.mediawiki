==Phenotype annotation editor==
===Enhance Phenote with necessary features to be productively and efficiently used by curators -- March 2008===
* '''[complete]''' Initial Phenote configuration for PhenoScape data model
* '''[complete]''' Specimen List window allowing curators to repeatedly choose one or more taxa for EQ annotation
* '''[complete]''' Phylogeny view for selecting taxa to annotate
* '''[complete]''' Search field to filter table rows
* '''[complete]''' Ontology mode in search field for more advanced table filtering
* '''[complete]''' Transition PhenoScape components to Phenote 2 docking windows interface
* '''[complete]''' Use standard menus and keyboard shortcuts for Open, Save, Quit, Cut, Copy, Paste, etc.
* '''[complete]''' Improved document saving functionality. User should be able to quickly save a document to the same file it was opened from.
* '''[complete]''' Rework Specimen List as Taxon List: each taxon has multiple specimens which can be picked from during annotation as supporting evidence
* Choose museum code from pick list when entering specimen IDs
* Character matrix view of annotations: Taxon by Entity+Attribute

===Features for the future===
* Annotation using temporary terms, when an appropriate term is not available in an ontology. Ability to update these terms to official term once it is available.
* Make DAG view work browsing entire ontology, with drag-and-drop to fields
* Allow user to see what version of ontology is being used
* Create lookup-enabled Publication field (enter DOI or PMID)

===Phenote integration with PhenoScape web application and database===


==Ontology editor==
===Curators begin by using OBO-Edit to view and edit project ontologies===
* '''[complete]''' Curators are using OBO-Edit successfully and no PhenoScape development


==A database and web application to store and query the taxonomies, ontologies, and phenotype data==
