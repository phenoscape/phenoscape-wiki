title: Needs Analysis Workshop/Summary
---

==Background==

The PhenoScape [[Needs Analysis Workshop]] was held September 17-18, 2007 at NESCent.  We invited [[Needs Analysis Workshop#Participants|9 scientists]] from the fields of morphology, development, evolution, genetics, and ichthyology to help us define what informatic tools need to exist in order to enable synthetic research that takes full advantage of the accumulated data in each of these fields.  We hoped to identify driving biological questions and use cases to guide the development of our software tools and database.

==Agenda==
After being introduced to the project goals, the meeting participants each provided a brief [[Needs Analysis Workshop/Chalk talks|chalk talk]] outlining their integrative research problems.  The participants then split into two break-out groups, each arranged around either the [[Needs Analysis Workshop/Breakout group 1|developmental genetics of morphology]] or the [[Needs Analysis Workshop/Breakout group 2|evolution of morphology]].  At the end of the day the groups merged again to discuss the [[Needs Analysis Workshop/Report-out Day1|research questions]] arising in the breakout groups.

The second day began with three break-out groups: [[Needs Analysis Workshop/Correlation Breakout|correlations]], [[Needs Analysis Workshop/Phylogeny Breakout|phylogeny]], and [[Needs Analysis Workshop/Semantics Breakout|semantics]].  As before, the whole group then [[Needs Analysis Workshop/Report-out Day2|discussed]] the uses cases arising in the break-out groups, and tried to identify priorities for the project.

==Driving questions/use cases==

The following is a bulleted list highlighting both research questions and software use cases produced by the discussion.  Minutes from the relevant session are linked next to each point.

* Use the database to identify discrete evolutionary modules [[Needs Analysis Workshop/Breakout group 1|BG1]]
** Depends on identifying patterns of evolutionary covariation among phenotypes
* For a branch hypothesized to be under positive selection (from e.g. a molecular analysis), identify candidate phenotypes that could have been selected for [[Needs Analysis Workshop/Breakout group 1|BG1]]
** Requires mapping phenotypic changes on phylogeny, visualizing synapomorphies
** Topology can be modified and the results of modification visualized
* Use the database to help with negative information - what knowledge is missing that is required to answer a particular question? [[Needs Analysis Workshop/Breakout group 1|BG1]]
* Integrate data regarding ecologic conditions, life history, adaptation, and evolutionary time with phenotypic and genetic data to elucidate mechanisms of phenotypic change [[Needs Analysis Workshop/Breakout group 2|BG2]]
** must integrate with existing databases, literature, across biological levels
** use other factors (environment, ecology) as constraints on data presentation
* User adds own annotations using modified curator interface, compares own data with database [[Needs Analysis Workshop/Breakout group 2|BG2]], [[Needs Analysis Workshop/Phylogeny Breakout|PB]]
** user may also want to store media such as images and movies
* Enrichment analysis: given a list of genes, find which phenotype terms are overrepresented among them [[Needs Analysis Workshop/Report-out Day1|RO1]]
* User is notified of additions or changes to the database relevant to him/her [[Needs Analysis Workshop/Report-out Day1|RO1]]
** save user-defined queries as RSS feeds
* Capture and represent within-species variation in phenotypes and genotypes [[Needs Analysis Workshop/Report-out Day1|RO1]]
** describe polyphenism dependent on environmental factors or variable gene expression
** view population frequencies of polymorphic phenotypes
** describe phenotypic change through developmental time series
* View traits related to particular parts of anatomy - just tail, or just vertebra [[Needs Analysis Workshop/Correlation Breakout|CB]]
* User view ancestral character states on tree using default reconstruction methods [[Needs Analysis Workshop/Correlation Breakout|CB]]
* User downloads data in a form useful for applying their own methods of character reconstruction [[Needs Analysis Workshop/Correlation Breakout|CB]]
* find cloud of similar annotations using summary matrices [[Needs Analysis Workshop/Correlation Breakout|CB]]
** traits vs traits, traits vs genes, genes vs genes
** cells would be number of branches on which the two traits change in common (traits vs traits), or number of mutants they have in common (traits vs traits, and traits vs genes), or number of traits in common (genes vs genes)
* User uses interactive tree view to select taxa for summary matrix [[Needs Analysis Workshop/Correlation Breakout|CB]]
* User selects one or more regions on body plan view to view traits(genes) affecting all [[Needs Analysis Workshop/Correlation Breakout|CB]]
** then map corresponding traits on tree
* User creates and edits a tree using MacClade-like interface, then visualizes character changes on tree [[Needs Analysis Workshop/Phylogeny Breakout|PB]]
* User may want to work with data regarding mutations actually underlying evolutionary change [[Needs Analysis Workshop/Semantics Breakout|SB]]
** different genetic states in different species
