This page describes the data model, data loading process, and query methods being developed for a new version of the Phenoscape Knowledgebase built on top of RDF and making use of standard OWL reasoners.

==Data model==
Phenotypes in the new data model are modeled as OWL class expressions. They are now constructed in an inverse fashion from the form in the original KB - rather than describing classes of particular qualities which inhere in particular structures, we describe parts which bear particular qualities (at the level of instance data the model is the same â€” ''inheres_in'' is the inverse of ''bearer_of'').

For example, "serrated dorsal fin":
* '''old:''' ''exhibits'' some (serrated and ''inheres_in'' some dorsal_fin)
* '''new:''' ''has_part'' some (dorsal_fin and ''bearer_of'' some serrated)

We can now model absence correctly. The previous version of the KB uses a quality class called 'absent' in a way which produces unintended inferences. In the new model we use universal quantification with negation. For "dorsal fin, absent":
* ''has_part'' only (not dorsal_fin)

For a localized absence we would use a nested ''has_part'':
* ''has_part'' some (head and ''has_part'' only (not scale))
