This page describes the data model, data loading process, and query methods being developed for a new version of the Phenoscape Knowledgebase built on top of RDF and making use of standard OWL reasoners.

==Data model==
Phenotypes in the new data model are modeled as OWL class expressions. They are now constructed in an inverse fashion from the form in the original KB - rather than describing classes of particular qualities which inhere in particular structures, we describe organisms which have parts which bear particular qualities (''inheres_in'' is the inverse of ''bearer_of'').
