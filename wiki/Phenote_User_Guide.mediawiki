==System requirements==
Phenote requires Java 1.5 (aka Java 5) or later to run.  An appropriate Java is pre-installed with Mac OS X 10.4 or newer (Phenote cannot run on Mac OS X 10.3).  For Windows, you can download the latest Java from http://www.java.com/.  If you're running Linux, please consult your system documentation.

==Installation==
Phenote can be downloaded from the [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=76834&package_id=270424 OBO Sourceforge project site].  There are separate downloads available for Mac and Windows, as well as a download of the application source code.  Download the appropriate zip file for your platform.
* '''Mac:''' Double-click the downloaded file to unzip it.  You should see the application, "Phenote.app".  Drag it anywhere you like to install.  Double-click the application to launch Phenote.
* '''Windows:'''  Double-click the downloaded file.  Click on "Extract all files" in the resulting window.  Use the Extraction Wizard to put the Phenote folder wherever you want.  Launch Phenote by double-clicking "Phenote.bat" inside the Phenote folder.  It will take several seconds for the Phenote window to appear.  ''Do not attempt to run Phenote from "inside" the zip file - it will not work properly without first extracting the files to another folder.''
* '''Linux/Unix:''' ''forthcoming''
