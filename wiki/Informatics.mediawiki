==PhenoScape Software Components==

We are building the following database and software components for this project.

* An editor to create, maintain, and manage the taxonomy of Ostariophysi. We will focus on a reference taxonomy derived from the [http://www.calacademy.org/RESEARCH/ichthyology/catalog/fishcatsearch.html Catalog of Fishes].<br/>A taxonomy is a hypothesis about the phylogeny of clades of organisms, and as such we need to allow ultimately for different taxonomies that a user can choose from.
* An editor to create, maintain, and manage the anatomical ontology for Ostariophysi (TAO).
* An editor to create, maintain, and manage phenotype annotations in EQ syntax ("[[EQ Editor]]"). This editor needs to tightly integrate with the character annotation workflow that morphologists collaborating in the project will follow.
* A database and web-application to store the taxonomies, ontologies, and phenotype data. The web-application will allow scientists to browse and query the ontologies as well as the phenotype data.<br/>Initially, the query capabilities will concentrate on implementing a select set of "use-cases", research questions that show the utility of the approach. Ultimately, we will build interfaces that allow researchers to ask open-ended questions of the data.

All software and database developments will be made freely available as open-source software, and we will make use of existing open-source projects as much as possible. For example, the ontology editor is being built on top of [http://oboedit.org OBO-Edit], and the EQ Editor will be based on, or synergize with, [http://www.phenote.org Phenote].

==[[Software roadmap]]==

At present, we have implemented
# A relational database to hold ontological definitions of concepts from ontologies such as the TTO, TAO, and PATO, and curated data from NeXML files
# A reasoner to extract implicit information by combining user assertions and inference rules such as transitive relations
# A query API to extract assertions from the database using combinations of taxon, entity, and quality parameters
# A front end application to query the database by Entity Quality (EQ) combinations
