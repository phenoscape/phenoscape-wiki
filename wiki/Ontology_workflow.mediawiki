title: Ontology workflow

====Using Version Control ====
SmartSVN is the SVN client we use for keeping local copies of ontologies on your computer synchronized with those in the SVN (SubVersion server)
To get SmartSVN, go to their site [http://www.smartsvn.com/SmartSVN]].

General workflow; begin each day by:
Starting up SmartSVN and update the phenoscape-ext repository.

For ontology editing, use the “Vocab” URL in Zigversion. “Vocab” folder contains ontology files for OBO-Edit.
Select the top-level folder named with a forward slash (/)
Click "update" to download recent versions of files to your local, working folder

Within OBO-edit, open the local copy of your file and proceed with your curation work.
After saving your file, go back to ZigVersion and “check in” your modified file(s) to the repository. Remember to add a comment to the bottom of the check in window describing the changes you made to the file.

Wasila uses SmartCVS as the CVS client for obtaining local copies of ontologies on the OBO CVS server.  Question: do all curators need this? Could also download ontologies directly from OBOFoundry and Phenoscape ontologies are kept in SVN.

====Making ontology edits using Protege 4====
