title: Roadmap for first iteration
---

This is a development roadmap for the first production iteration of the Phenoscape database and web interface, for introduction at the [http://www.sicb.org/meetings/2009/index.php3 SICB 2009 meeting].
==Nov. 10-14==
===Jim===
* Document interface design requirements on wiki
* Investigate and begin documenting additional data service needs required by interface
* Start Rails web interface project; commit to SVN.
* Write EQ count script, as per Paula's request, using Ruby; provide results to Phenoscape mailing list.

===Cartik===
* '''Complete''' Set up Eclipse project for Restlet based web service application on personal machine, commit to OBD-WS SVN.
** Cartik and Jim worked together on this and discussed the basics of Restlet applications.
** Can be found in SVN at https://obo.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/obo/OBD-WS/trunk
* Begin implementing dummy term info and autocomplete services.

==Nov. 17-21==
===Jim===
* Document data retrieval web service specifications
** Anatomy
** Taxon
** Genes
* Implement Rails app skeleton and code front page
* Implement reusable JavaScript term info panel and embed in front page search interface.
* Address NEXUS/Phenote file merging issues with Paula. Provide problematic files as NeXML to Paula and Wasila.

===Cartik===
* Deploy OBD-WS application; continue deploying in-progress builds.
** Package as WAR, deploy on Eryops.
** Include dummy autocomplete and term info services.
* Begin implementing live Term Info service within OBD-WS application.
* Begin implementing live Autocomplete service within OBD-WS application.

==Nov. 24-28==
===Jim===
* mostly on vacation
===Cartik===
* Complete Term Info service
* Complete Autocomplete service.
* Provide dummy Anatomy, Taxon, and Gene data service(s).

==Dec. 1-5==
===Jim===
* Implement anatomy UI.
* Begin using autocomplete and term info services in all so-far developed user interfaces.
===Cartik===
* Write code to parse ZFIN phenotype data and load into OBD
** See http://zfin.org/zf_info/downloads.html#phenotype
** Data: http://zfin.org/data_transfer/Downloads/pheno_obo.txt
** should use "exhibits" relation
* Enhance OBD data loader pipeline to perform pre-processing of ZFA ontology, replacing xrefs with is_a links to TAO
** These xrefs seem to still be in TAO - may have to fix that or work around

==Dec. 8-12==
===Jim===
* Complete anatomy user interface.
* Begin implementing taxon user interface.
===Cartik===

* Implement data service(s) related to Anatomy (requirements documented Nov. 17-21).

==Dec. 15-19==
===Jim===
* Complete taxon user interface.
* Implement and complete gene user interface.
===Cartik===
* Complete implementing Anatomy data services.
* Begin implementing Taxon data services.

==Dec. 22 - Jan. 2 (2 weeks)==
===Jim===
* Mostly on vacation.
===Cartik===
* Complete Taxon data services.
* Completely implement Gene data services.

==Outcome==
===Query UI===
*Anatomy
*Taxon
*Gene
===Data Content===
