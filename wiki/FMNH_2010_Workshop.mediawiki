title: FMNH 2010 Workshop
---

The Phenoscape group is developing informatics and tools for integrating morphological data across studies and with genetic and developmental data.  The user interface and tools are being designed to address the general needs of the systematics and ‘evo-devo’ community, and we need your input.  Come to learn about new methods that are applicable to any group and to work hands-on with the knowledgebase (kb.phenoscape.org).
