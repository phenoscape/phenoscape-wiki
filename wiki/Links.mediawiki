===NCBO BioPortal support requests===

Support (for issues) and feature requests for the NCBO BioPortal can be submitted through the following venues (according to Benjamin Dai, BioPortal Lead Software Architect):
* [https://bmir-gforge.stanford.edu/gf/project/bioportal_core/tracker/ BioPortal 2.0 Tracker] at the BMIR GForge installation

'''NCBO BioPortal User Group:'''

We are a (voting) member of the BioPortal User Group. The group has monthly teleconferences where new features are being discusses and subsequently prioritized through survey-voting.

* A Basecamp-based [https://ncboprojects.updatelog.com/projects/1487611/project/log BioPortal project management site] (login required) has User Group meeting presentations and other information.

=Bibliography=

We also maintain a list of references on [http://www.connotea.org Connotea], using the tag "[http://www.connotea.org/tag/phenoscape phenoscape]". This list may be more up-to-date than the bibliography below. Anyone can easily recommend references (and in fact any site or resource) to us simply by tagging it with "phenoscape" in Connotea.
