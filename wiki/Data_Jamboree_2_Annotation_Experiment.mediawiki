title: Data Jamboree 2/Annotation Experiment
---

====Background:====
The curation experiment was given to five curators on the third day of the [[Data_Jamboree_2/Agenda | data jamboree]]. The goals of the experiment were to assess curation consistency among a group of new curators, and to identify areas of improvement in curator training, ontology development, and software improvement.  

====Participant Training:====
Only one of the five curators had experience using Phenex prior to the data roundup.  Training for all curators consisted of:

* A hands-on, group curation exercise led and assisted by experienced curators given on the first day of the data roundup
* Two days of individual curation work on publications related to each participant's area of taxonomic expertise, with assistance from project personnel
* For reference, participants were given an [[Guide_to_Character_Annotation | Annotation Guide]] with examples of character types commonly encountered in the fish systematic literature
