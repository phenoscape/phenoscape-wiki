== Curation consistency experiment: Review of Results ==

Character #2
* difference between depth, length, width
* some failed to post-compose (e.g., increased length)
* need to standardize shape, length, depth, and width definitions
* should then use higher level character (such as 'shape')

Character #3
* some use 'increased count' which is-a count

Character #4
* question of whether basihyal bone precludes presence (or implies absence) of cartilage
* question of how to annotate this looks more difficult than in reality is
* basihyal cartilage absent implies basihyal bone absent (because the latter develops from the former)
** in fact it can also be that the cartilage is absent b/c it has developed into the bone (completely ossified)
** hence need to add that basihyal is absent too
* graph view can be very helpful

Character #5
* software should prevent filling in relative entities for qualities that aren't relational
* post-composed relative entity because of uncertainty of whether the full (existing) term would be compatible with the definition the author may have been using (for a different clade)
* difficulty to find the 'bony projection' by auto-completion (because it doesn't pop up when typing the beginnings of 'projection')
* problem of capturing the 'overlaps with' aspect in addition to 'anterior to'
* full text search of the definitions would be very useful

Character #6
* hypural is also contained within the upper lobe of the caudal fin
* difficulty of finding and comparing definitions of relationship types

Character #7
* Software should ensure that entity starts with an entity term if post-composed, not a quality

Character #8
* sphenotic needs to go into the comment field

Character #9
* too complex to express the exact nature of the orientation, so choose just 'orientation'

Character #10
* triradiate versus tripartite
