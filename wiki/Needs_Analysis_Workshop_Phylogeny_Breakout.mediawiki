title: Needs Analysis Workshop/Phylogeny Breakout
---

Participants: Monte Westerfield, Paula Mabee, Cartik Muthu, Chuck Kimmel, Wasila Dahdul, Hans Hofman


PM - what are participants most interested in?

	-computing tree on the fly?

	-repository of trees?

	-manipulation of existing trees?

Group consensus - want the ability to deliver trees and ability to manipulate them

HH – want the ability to map as many phenotypic traits as possible; character mapping with phenotypic transitions, gains/losses, correlated changes; have sets of data mapped on tree – for example , all in situs done for a particular gene…

CK – interested in getting figures on the phylogeny

HH – note whether in situs have been done at all for species of interest;  see which species have that data, download all the images.
 
CK - interested in output/reports of statistics, such as statistics for testing character correlation

HH - also independent contrasts to assess character independence
