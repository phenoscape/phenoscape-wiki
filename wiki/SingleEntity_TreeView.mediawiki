=== Taxonomic Scope ===

=== Display qualities using a grid of colored tiles===

* Qualities are displayed with consistent location and color in the grid
* Desaturated colors are used for qualities of phenotypes that are inferred, rather than annotated
** Note annotation to Ictaluridae in this and next candidate example
* The 16 tile designs are intended to support expansion of the list of qualities used in curation - as has already happened.

===Display qualities using icons strung along branches===
* Qualities are displayed with consistent icon, color and relative position along branches
* As above, desaturated colors are used for inferred qualities
* Additional icons may be added

== Version 0 ==
=== Display qualities using text icons adjacent to taxon names ===

* user enters any entity term
* each of the standard upper-level PATO qualities has some icon
* each node of tree is annotated with icons for which kinds of phenotypes are exhibited by that node
* so if you just put in "bone", you could get a "shape" icon at a node for any bone shape phenotype (basihyal bone round, vertebra 1 flat, etc.)
