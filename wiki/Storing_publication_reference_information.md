## Problem

It would be simplest to store references to articles as an ID number
which can be looked up elsewhere. Here are some possibilities in order
of preference:

1.  DOI or Handle (\*)
2.  Pubmed ID (\*\*)
3.  SICI numbers, if the publisher uses it for a stable URL
4.  Biodiversity Heritage Library URL of the article
5.  constructed SICI ID (\*\*\*,\*\*\*\*)
6.  constructed
    <a href="OpenURL" class="wikilink" title="OpenURL">OpenURL</a>

(\*) I doubt that there are articles with both a DOI \*and\* a handle,
but if you encounter one, use the DOI. There is a text query interface
to look up DOI at CrossRef: <http://www.crossref.org/SimpleTextQuery/>

For most articles earlier than 1997 there almost certainly won't be a
DOI. Try JSTOR and use their SICI-based link but the best way for those
that can't be readily assigned an identifier is to enter the complete
citation.

(\*\*) There aren't many articles with Pubmed ID that lack a DOI, but
it's possible for pre-1998 pubs.

(\*\*\*\*) Requires ISSN for construction, won't work for book sections
