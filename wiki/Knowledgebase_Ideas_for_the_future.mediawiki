# Commenting feature (from Sandrine's beta testing sheet)
The database gives a better direct access to huge amounts of data, it has to enable communication among scientists in more precise and more dynamic ways too. Thus it is very important to allow users to add comments (on a single litigious character or observation for example). So how could users add comments on the registered data? How could they discuss, make decisions on statements? Would it be feasible with the present structure of the database?
