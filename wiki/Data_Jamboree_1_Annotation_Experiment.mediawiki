title: Data Jamboree 1/Annotation Experiment
---

====Background and Participant Preparation====

An annotation experiment was conducted on day 2 of the Phenoscape Data Jamboree in order to assess curation consistency among the four trained participants.  Training consisted of a hands-on group annotation exercise on day 1, and individual work on each participant's own publications with assistance from project personnel on days 1 and 2. An Annotation Guide with examples of character types commonly encountered in the fish systematic literature was also given to participants.  Participants were given 2 hours to annotate 10 characters (plus one extra credit) taken from three publications (Hilton 2003, Sanger and McCune 2002, Zanata and Vari 2005).

====Results and Conclusions====

=====Completeness of annotations=====
Three of the four participants attempted annotations for all 11 characters, while one participant finished only 7 characters. All participants recorded the character number, textual description, and selected the appropriate voucher specimen for each annotation. Only two of the four participants recorded evidence codes for each annotation. 

=====Variability of EQ statements=====
A summary of annotation consistency among participants is presented in the table below (incomplete annotations due to software issues are excluded).

* *incomplete annotations due to software issues were excluded


Participants annotated only one character identically. Variation in the other annotations was due to several reasons.  Most commonly, participants differed in how they post-composed entity terms, particularly in how entities were related in post-composition (for example, use of part_of/has_part).  Participants also varied in choosing the appropriate quality term among many similar choices.  Another point of difference was due to confusion in the definition of an anatomy term, pointing to the importance of consistently naming bone terms in the TAO.  

The results of the annotation experiment highlight the need for annotation standards, and stream-lining of the software interface so that curators are not faced with so many similar choices for quality terms and relations.  These needs are currently being addressed.
