title: Data Jamboree 1/Annotation Experiment
---

====Background and Participant Preparation====

An annotation experiment was conducted on day 2 of the Phenoscape Data Jamboree in order to assess curation consistency among the four trained participants. Participant training consisted of a hands-on group annotation exercise on day 1, and individual work on each participant's own publications with assistance from project personnel on days 1 and 2. Participants were also given an Annotation Guide with examples of character types commonly encountered in the fish systematic literature.  Participants were given 2 hours to annotate 10 characters (plus one extra credit) taken from three publications (Hilton 2003, Sanger and McCune 2002, Zanata and Vari 2005).
