===Notes from chalk talks:===

* '''John Lundberg''': 
** ~30,000 teleost species
** ostariophysi most important group of freshwater fish
* '''Arhat Abzhanov''':
** drivers and evolution of cranial development
** beak development and diversification among Galapagos finches
** comparative relationships of developmental pathways of interacting and regulatory genes
* '''Hans Hofman''':
** individual variation in gene expression, pathways, physiology, anatomy, behaviour, etc
** variation at the population and species level, such as ecology, biogeography, natural history, etc
** how to link these two through, for example, a data repository
** how to implement the ability for open-ended queries
** how to connect this to development time, plasticity, genotype/environment interactions
* '''Toby Kellogg''':
** grasses have about 10,000 species, e.g., rice, maize
** which meristem-specific genes have been conserved or evolutionarily changed
** challenge: how to get from a list of genes to the 3'UTR to use for in-situs for same or different species
** designing primers for an entire clade based on a multiple alignment
** automating the pipeline is major challenge
* '''Austin Mast''':
** MorphBank
** Slide-server interface
** bulk annotation, 'tile' layout
* '''Elizabeth Jokusch''':
** beetle antennae: scape (1), pedicel (1), flagellum (typically 9 segments, but many exceptions)
** Tribolium: flagellum -> funicle and club, with variable number of segments
** using RNAi to induce changes (phenotypes) in these
** e.g. reduced number of antenna segments, fusions of antenna segments, deletions
** how to code these phenotypes so one can ask for broader patterns, non-randomness
* '''Chuck Kimmel''':
** role of cells in skeletal shape forming
** what are the activities of cells controlled by developmental genes
** devo hypothesis: modular assembly?
** what is the broad nature of shape diversity (of, e.g., certain bones)
** evo hyothesis: a missing module?
** how could a database help with the shape transformation
* '''GÃ¼nter Wagner''':
** evolution of limbs, gene duplication in teleosts, internal development of human
** following the genes to the taxa they lead to
** comparative cell morphology and cell physiology
** what to compare to in organisms that don't have a particular cell type? e.g. myelinated cells comparing to lampreys (which have only glial cells)
* '''David Stern''' (Tuesday):
** trait differences between Drosophila species
** database of evolutionary mutations and their phenotypes fixed through drift or selection (EvolGen)
* '''Hopi Hoekstra''' (Tuesday):
** Peromyscus trait evolution
