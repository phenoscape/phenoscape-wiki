== Introduction ==

The goal of this workshop is to discuss plans for a renewal of the Phenoscape NSF grant, to be submitted in July 2009. Specific aims of the renewal are to be determined by the workshop participants. An initial list includes creating the informatics tools necessary to integrate and mediate between different concepts of homology, extending the systematics legacy data transformation to all vertebrates, and laboratory case-studies for following up specific hypotheses generated by the expanding knowledge base.
