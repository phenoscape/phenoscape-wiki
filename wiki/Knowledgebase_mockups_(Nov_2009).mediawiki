==Publications==
Integration of publication data across site.

===Publication results on term search pages===
* this shows an entity page (entopterygoid) - could have similar layout on taxon and gene searches
* for each row (phenotype class) - see how many publication are linked to any EQs of that type
* click one of the count links to go to a page listing those publications

===List of publications===
* click one of the links to go to that publication's detail page

===Publication detail page===
* matrix will usually be much bigger - will be scrollable
* click column header or cell links to go to a phenotype details page showing all related EQs grouped by taxon (as on existing phenotype pages)

====Comments====

==Tree mapping==
===Map 2 phenotypes on tree===
* user can enter phenotype specification for each "state"
* see on tree which branches exhibit one or both of the phenotypes
* Do user's want the tree "pruned"?  Or show branches without annotations also?  could be a lot of taxa

===Same interface===
* shows that the 2 phenotypes don't have to be obvious alternatives

===Map phenotypes of a given entity on tree===
* user enters any entity term
* each of the standard upper-level PATO qualities has some icon
* each node of tree is annotated with icons for which kinds of phenotypes are exhibited by that node
* so if you just put in "bone", you could get a "shape" icon at a node for any bone shape phenotype (basihyal bone round, vertebra 1 flat, etc.)
