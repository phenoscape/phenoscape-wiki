==Publications==

=== ''Revision 1''  ===

Revision 1 posted on 12/16/09 by Wasila based on amphibanat feedback, Phenoscape conference call (11/20/09), discussion with Paula (12/14/09), and conference call with John Lundberg (12/18/09). The Powerpoint file containing the revisions is on the webdav.

====Publication results on anatomy term search pages, revision 1====
Additional feedback not on mockup:
* John likes separate column for publications (as in previous revision), maybe add 'KB Publications' vs. book icon in taxon column.

====Publication detail page, revision 1 ====

====Publication detail page: viewing matrix and character of interest ====
from conference call 12/18/09
"how to show character of interest? should entopterygoid be first column (even if author lists as #4 or #79)? or should there be a slider or 'next' arrow that allows users to view additional characters?"

Mockups added on 12/21/09 by Wasila.

=== ''Original mockups'' ===
Integration of publication data across site.

====Publication results on term search pages====
* this shows an entity page (entopterygoid) - could have similar layout on taxon and gene searches
* for each row (phenotype class) - see how many publication are linked to any EQs of that type
* click one of the count links to go to a page listing those publications

[[Image:pubs1.png|700px]]

====List of publications====
* click one of the links to go to that publication's detail page

[[Image:pubs2.png|700px]]

====Publication detail page====
* matrix will usually be much bigger - will be scrollable
* click column header or cell links to go to a phenotype details page showing all related EQs grouped by taxon (as on existing phenotype pages)

====Comments====

==Tree mapping==
===Map 2 phenotypes on tree===
* user can enter phenotype specification for each "state"
* see on tree which branches exhibit one or both of the phenotypes
* Do users want the tree "pruned"?  Or show branches without annotations also?  could be a lot of taxa

===Same interface===
* shows that the 2 phenotypes don't have to be obvious alternatives

[[Image:trees2.png|700px]]

===Map phenotypes of a given entity on tree===
* user enters any entity term
* each of the standard upper-level PATO qualities has some icon
* each node of tree is annotated with icons for which kinds of phenotypes are exhibited by that node
* so if you just put in "bone", you could get a "shape" icon at a node for any bone shape phenotype (basihyal bone round, vertebra 1 flat, etc.)

===Comments===

==Phenotype queries==
===Entry of phenotype specification===
* user enters a phenotype specification, presses Done

[[Image:queries1.png|700px]]

===Additional phenotype specification===
* bottom of page shows taxa which exhibit first phenotype
* user pressed "+" under first phenotype and can enter another

[[Image:queries2.png|700px]]

===Results===
* taxa exhibiting both phenotypes are shown

===Comments===
What should happen upon clicking taxon names? --[[User:Jpb15|jim]] 11:38, 18 November 2009 (EST)
* go to taxon's page?
* go to phenotype listing for that taxon and given phenotypes?
