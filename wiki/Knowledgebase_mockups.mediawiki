==Grouping data by using an ontology tree view==
===Phenotype results===
This would be an enhancement to the results currently displayed on a page like http://kb.phenoscape.org/phenotype/evo/TTO:10930/TAO:0000326/PATO:0000070/

The nearest common ancestor term of the annotated taxon terms is used as the root of the tree display.  The only leaf terms displayed are those with annotations.  Internal nodes show the union of the annotations to their descendant nodes.

===Search summary results===
This would be an enhancement to the results currently displayed on a page like http://kb.phenoscape.org/search/anatomy/TAO:0000376

The nearest common ancestor of the represented annotated anatomy terms is used as the root of the tree display.  Each anatomy term has a flat list of the qualities annotated for it.  ''Don't pay too much attention to the dummy numbers given in these results.''

Root anatomy term "infraorbital" collapsed:

Root anatomy term "infraorbital" expanded:

Possible further enhancement to page capabilities - redisplay data on a quality tree.  The included results would be somewhat different.

Nearest quality ancestor collapsed:
