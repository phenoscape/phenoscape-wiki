===Additional data types and query constraints===
[[Image:Day2-dataintegration.whiteboard.JPG|thumb|right|384px|Data interrelationships]]
* Other data types or dimensions we haven't looked at
** Time: e.g., developmental time-series
** Geography
* Abilities to restrict traits by
** high-level character modules
** gene
** GO
** location
** developmental stage
** availability of sufficient data

===Prioritization===

* Character mapping on trees
* Correlation matrix of traits
* Downloadable reports of query results (e.g. candidate genes; comparative phenotypic data)
* Identifying clades which traits vary (quick retrieval of character state distributions)
* Phenotypic BLAST to discover similar phenotypes and similar OTUs
* Discovery of genetic or evolutionary modules
* Integrating genetic data

===Visualizations:===
* body map
* filtering options
* visualizing the ontology
* external data types, link-out to NCBI
