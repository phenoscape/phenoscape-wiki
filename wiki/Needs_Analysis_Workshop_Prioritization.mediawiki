title: Needs Analysis Workshop/Prioritization
---

===Additional data types and query constraints===

* Other data types or dimensions we haven't looked at
** Time: e.g., developmental time-series
** Geography
* Abilities to restrict traits by
** high-level character modules
** gene
** GO
** location
** developmental stage
** availability of sufficient data

===Prioritization===

* Character mapping on trees
* Correlation matrix of traits
* Downloadable reports of query results
* Identifying clades which traits vary
* Phenotypic BLAST to discover similar phenotypes and similar OTUs
* Discovery of genetic or evolutionary modules
* Integrating genetic data

===Visualizations:===
* body map
* filtering options
* visualizing the ontology
* external data types, link-out to NCBI
