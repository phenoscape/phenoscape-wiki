The following instructions outline the resources used by Phenoscape
curators for the annotation of evolutionary phenotypes. If you are a
student intern, please refer to the [Student
Instructions](http://phenoscape.org/wiki/Student_Instructions) page for
more information and links.

Data uploaded to the Phenoscape Knowledgebase are made available under a
Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported license (see

## 1. Download Most Recent Version of Phenex

Phenex was developed by Phenoscape for annotation of evolutionary
phenotypes. You can find instructions for downloading and installing
Phenex at the
<a href="Phenex" class="wikilink" title="Phenex homepage"><strong>Phenex
homepage</strong></a>.

## 2. Access Project Files

Phenoscape project files are XML files (more specifically, they are in
[NeXML](http://nexml.org) format) created using Phenex and available on
GitHub at <https://github.com/phenoscape/phenoscape-data>.

## 3. Access PDFs for Curation

Phenoscape maintains a collection of PDFs for curation. Please ask
project personnel (Wasila or Paula) for access to the collection.

## 4. Use Ontologies to Annotate Characters

The primary activity of a curator is to annotate the free-text
characters from systematic studies using ontologies. Instructions for
this activity can be found in the
<a href="Guide_to_Character_Annotation" class="wikilink"
title=" Phenoscape Guide to Character Annotation"> <strong>Phenoscape
Guide to Character Annotation</strong></a>.

## 5. Update Taxon Lists

Most project files require a taxonomic expert to review the taxonomy
used in a publication and update to reflect current taxonomy. Please see
instructions for <a href="Creating_Taxon_Lists" class="wikilink"
title=" creating taxon lists"> <strong>creating taxon lists</strong></a>
in Phenex or instructions for
<a href="Update_Taxon_Lists" class="wikilink"
title=" updating taxon lists"> <strong>updating taxon lists</strong></a>
with valid taxon names.

## 6. Request New Terms for Ontologies

Curation drives ontology development and many new terms and
relationships need to be added. Submit requests for updates to the
ontologies used in Phenoscape to the following term trackers:

- [Uber Anatomy Ontology (Uberon) term
  tracker](https://github.com/cmungall/uberon/issues)
- [Phenotype and Trait Ontology (PATO) term
  tracker](http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=76834&atid=595654)
- [Vertebrate Taxonomy Ontology (VTO) term
  tracker](http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=224046&atid=2519810)
- [Collection Codes
  Vocabulary](http://phenoscape.org/wiki/Ontologies#Fish_Collection_Codes_Vocabulary)

## 7. Edit the Anatomy Ontology
