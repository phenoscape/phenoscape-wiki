title: Matrix annotation workflow
---

The first Phenoscape [[Data Jamboree 1|data jamboree]] revealed that our curation workflow implemented in Phenote could be quite cumbersome, particularly in managing the huge numbers of rows containing annotations for every taxon.  Discussion after the jamboree settled on a new workflow which allows more division of effort, allowing experienced curators to focus on the description of phenotypes using EQ, while input of specimen lists and character matrices can be done separately, possibly by assistants.

==Workflow activities==
This workflow is divided into 3 main activities, each of which can be performed independently and in parallel.

===EQ character state coding===

===Taxon and specimen lists===

===Character matrix===
