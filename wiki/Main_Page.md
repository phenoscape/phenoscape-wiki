## Enabling Machine-actionable Semantics for Comparative Analysis of Trait Evolution

The current project of the Phenoscape team is Enabling
Machine-actionable **S**emantics for **C**omparative **A**nalysis of
**T**rait **E**volution (SCATE).

The objective is to create infrastructure that will provide comparative
trait analysis tools easy access to algorithms powered by machine
reasoning with the semantics of trait descriptions. Similar to how
Google, IBM Watson, and others have enabled developers of smartphone
apps to incorporate, with only a few lines of code, complex
machine-learning and artificial intelligence capabilities such as
sentiment analysis, we aim to demonstrate how easy access to knowledge
computing opens up new opportunities for analysis, tools, and research
in comparative trait analysis.

As driving biological research questions, we focus on addressing three
long-standing limitations in comparative studies of trait evolution:
recombining trait data, modeling trait evolution, and generating
testable hypotheses for the drivers of trait adaptation.

SCATE is funded by NSF collaborative grants DBI-1661456 (Duke
University), DBI-1661529 (Virginia Tech), DBI-1661516 (University of
South Dakota), and DBI-1661356 (UNC Chapel Hill and RENCI) from Sep 1,
2017 to Aug 31, 2020.
