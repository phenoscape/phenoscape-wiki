This page provides a broad overview of our software development activities. Phenoscape supports open development processes and collaboration. All source code we create is available from open source repositories such as [http://github.com/phenoscape Github] and [http://sourceforge.net/projects/phenoscape/ Sourceforge], and we work with existing open-source projects whenever possible.

==Phenoscape Knowledgebase==
One of the chief objectives of the Phenoscape project is to present a centralized repository to store evolutionary phenotype annotations entered by curators and also integrate relevant data imported from partner projects. The Knowledgebase consists of a back-end semantic data store, a web service application which provides a query API for the data, a web application user interface allowing exploration of the Knowledgebase, and accessory tools for loading data.
===Production version===
The live Phenoscape Knowledgebase is available at http://kb.phenoscape.org/. It makes use of the following software projects:
