==Break-out Group 2: Evolution of morphology==

Examples for driving research questions:
* What is the set of genes that are associated with a particular type of morphological change that occurred independently in several clades during evolution? 
* Which genes are responsible for evolutionary change in the shape of a particular body part? 
* What evolutionary phenotype mirrors a particular human disease?

Participants: Toby Kellogg, Austin Mast, Hans Hofmann, Arhat Abzhanov, Todd Vision, Wasila Dahdul, Hilmar Lapp, Peter Midford

TK - would like to avoid producing something that's too general to be useful

HH - provided an example of a workflow of research he conducts

HH - Molecular basis of chage in the brain as it relates to behavior; change meaning development, plasticity in adult, evolutionary change.

--have two populations that differ in escape response

--have knowledge of physiology, hormones, neural circuitry (morphology) ==> relates to M-cell

--questions: does it relate to ecology? if genetic changes occurred between populations, how did evolve?

--collect imaging data, have sparser data on electrophysiology time series

--M-cell --> extract RNA for profiling or CGH --> get candidate genes.  Imaging issues

--kinds of data collected: expression imaging, histological sections, videos of behavior

--Interested in integrating across biological levels, literature, existing databases

TK - what is integration? how do you handle this data flow now?

HH - covariance matrix, examine c-turn behavior associated with a particular cluster of individuals, determine which candidate genes correspond

-- some genes don't cluster with his measures, so the database could fill in that information
