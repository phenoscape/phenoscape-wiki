title: Absence Phenotypes in OWL
---

Phenotypes describing the absence of a type of structure require particular consideration for both semantic modeling and reasoning.

==Basic EQ modeling==
We generally represent phenotypes as classes describing relationships between an entity and a quality. The entity is usually an anatomical structure, such as a '''dorsal fin''', which is the ''bearer_of'' some quality, such as an instance of '''serrated'''. The inverse of ''bearer_of'' is ''inheres_in'', so we can either describe the set of organisms with this phenotype:

''has_part'' some ('''dorsal fin''' and ''bearer_of'' some '''serrated''')

or describe this class of phenotypes (from the perspective of the quality):

'''serrated''' and ''inheres_in'' some '''dorsal fin'''

These expressions are not equivalent but describe different aspects of the same data model.

=="Absent" quality==
The PATO ontology of phenotypic qualities includes a commonly used quality '''absent'''. However, using this term in the above EQ model is problematic. For the entity '''dorsal fin''' and the quality '''absent''', we would end up with an expression such as ''has_part'' some ('''dorsal fin''' and ''bearer_of'' some '''absent'''). The obvious problem is that this asserts the existence of a '''dorsal fin''', needed to bear the instance of '''absent'''.

==Using OWL class complements or cardinality==
Instead of representing absence with a quality, we can describe it in OWL using a class complement (logical negation):

not (''has_part'' some '''dorsal fin''')

=="Lacks all parts of type" quality==
The solution provided by PATO for the above problem is the "relational" quality '''lacks all parts of type'''. Relational qualities in PATO are further specified by a relation to another class, for example '''sensitivity''' toward '''ultraviolet light'''. So instead of describing an entity '''dorsal fin''' which bears an '''absent''' quality, we should instead describe the entity '''body''' which bears a quality '''lacks all parts of type''' toward '''dorsal fin'''.
