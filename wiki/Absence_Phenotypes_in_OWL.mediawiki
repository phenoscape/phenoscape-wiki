title: Absence Phenotypes in OWL
---

Phenotypes describing the absence of a type of structure require particular consideration for both semantic modeling and reasoning.

==EQ modeling==
We generally represent phenotypes as classes describing relationships between an entity and a quality. The entity is usually an anatomical structure, such as a '''dorsal fin''', which is the ''bearer_of'' some quality, such as an instance of '''serrated'''. The inverse of bearer_of is inheres_in, so we can either describe the set of organisms with this phenotype:

''has_part'' some ('''dorsal fin''' and ''bearer_of'' some '''serrated''')

or describe this class of phenotypes (from the quality perspective):

'''serrated''' and ''inheres_in'' some '''dorsal fin'''
