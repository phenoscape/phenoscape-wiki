title: Relating taxa to phenotypes
---

In Phenoscape, we are annotating the phenotypes of species, as described in systematic literature.  Because we are working within an ontological framework, we require a well-defined relation to link a taxon to a phenotype.  This page describes the properties of, and issues related to, our proposed relation, ''exhibits''.

==Defining ''exhibits''==
===Proposed definition===
A taxon X ''exhibits'' phenotype Y if phenotype Y has been observed in some organism which is a member of taxon X.
===Discussion===
In an ideal world, all phenotype annotations would be directly to some organism specimen where the phenotype was observed.  However, for various reasons direct specimen annotation is not feasible in practice.  So, we create phenotype annotations for "leaf" taxa, species.  As the given definition suggests, ''exhibits'' statements do not preclude polymorphism within the taxon.  Some member organsims of that taxon may have one phenotype while others may have another.  For example:
* Species X ''exhibits'' "round dorsal fin"
is not in conflict with another annotation:
* Species X ''exhibits'' "pointed dorsal fin"
Both have been observed within members of this species.  Furthermore, phenotypic qualities within PATO cannot really be considered to be alternatives to one another.  For example:
* Species X ''exhibits'' "yellow dorsal fin"
would not be supposed an alternative to either of the previous two phenotypes.  The situation is no different between "round" and "pointed" themselves.
