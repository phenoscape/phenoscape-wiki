title: Relating taxa to phenotypes
---

In Phenoscape, we are annotating the phenotypes of species, as described in systematic literature.  Because we are working within an ontological framework, we require a well-defined relation to link a taxon to a phenotype.  This page describes the properties of, and issues related to, our proposed relation, ''exhibits''.

==Defining ''exhibits''==
===Proposed definition===
A taxon X exhibits phenotype Y if phenotype Y has been observed in some organism which is a member of taxon X.
