title: Relating taxa to phenotypes
---

In Phenoscape, we are annotating the phenotypes of species, as described in systematic literature.  Because we are working within an ontological framework, we require a well-defined relation to link a taxon to a phenotype.  This page describes the properties of, and issues related to, our proposed relation, ''exhibits''.

==Defining ''exhibits''==
===Proposed definition===
A taxon X ''exhibits'' phenotype Y if phenotype Y has been observed in some organism which is a member of taxon X.
===Discussion===
In an ideal world, all phenotype annotations would be directly to some organism specimen where the phenotype was observed.  However, for various reasons direct specimen annotation is not feasible in practice.  So, we create phenotype annotations for "tip" taxa, species.
