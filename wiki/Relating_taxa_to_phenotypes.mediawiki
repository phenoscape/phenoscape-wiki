title: Relating taxa to phenotypes
---

In Phenoscape, we are annotating the phenotypes of species, as described in systematic literature.  Because we are working within an ontological framework, we require a well-defined relation to link a taxon to a phenotype.  This page describes the properties of and issues related to our proposed relation, ''exhbits''.
