== Evolutionary Biology and Ontologies Workshop: June 20, 2008 ==

[[Image:Evolution2008-OntologyWorkshop.png|right]]
This workshop will be held in conjunction with the [http://www.cce.umn.edu/conferences/evolution/ Evolution 2008] meeting in Minneapolis, MN, 20 June 2008. It is organized under the auspices of the [http://ncbo.us National Center for Biomedical Ontologies] (NCBO) in collaboration with the [http://www.nescent.org/ National Evolutionary Synthesis Center] (NESCent).

; Organizers: Barry Smith (Buffalo), Paula Mabee (University of South Dakota), Todd Vision (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill), Monte Westerfield (University of Oregon)

; Focus: This meeting is focused on the application of ontologies to studies in evolutionary biology and related disciplines, with a particular emphasis on studies of the phenotype.

; Goals:
:# Introducing what ontologies are, how they should be built, what makes an ontology useful, and how ontologies help people collaborate across disciplines;
:# Giving illustrations of ontologies actually being used to address problems of interest to evolutionary biologists;
:# Networking and planning: what do we do next in order to advance ontology-based information integration in evolutionary biology?

; Registration: Registration will be open to attendees of the Evolution 2008 conference at no additional cost.

Further information can be found at the [http://www.bioontology.org/wiki/index.php/Evolutionary_Biology_and_Ontologies workshop page at the NCBO wiki]. There is also a [http://www.nescent.org/documents/EBO_Flyer.pdf  workshop flier] for dissemination. Please feel free to distribute the flier to your colleagues and students.

== First Morphology Data Jamboree: April 18-20, 2008 ==

The first Data Jamboree on Morpholoy with project personnel, affiliated ichthyologists and curators, and external advisors was held at NESCent on April 18-20, 2008.

== Needs Analysis Workshop: September 17-18, 2007 ==

The Needs Analysis Workshop brought together leading scientists from the fields of morphology, development, evolution, genetics, and ichthyology to identify driving biological research questions that take the most advantage of the evolutionary, anatomical, developmental, and genetics data that the Phenoscape will integrate. In particular, the workshop aimed to identify what informatic tools are needed in order to answer those questions. The workshop was held at NESCent on September 17-18, 2007.
