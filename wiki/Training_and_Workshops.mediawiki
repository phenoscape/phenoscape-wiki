Organizers:
* Paula Mabee, Professor, Dept. of Biology, University of South Dakota
* Anne Maglia, Professor, Missouri University of Science and Technology
* Todd Vision, Assistant Director, National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NESCent) and Associate Professor, Dept. of Biology, University of North Carolina
* Monte Westerfield, Director, Zebrafish Information Network and Professor, Institute of Neuroscience, University of Oregon

The aim of this workshop to promote the integration of ichtyological and herpetological data with genetic, genomic, and developmental data for the purposes of understanding the genetic basis for phenotypic variation and diversification.  The focus will be on major anatomical ontology efforts already underway in these organisms, and their use within new and existing morphological databases.

While knowledge from model organism biology can inform our understanding of natural phenotypic variation and evolution, differing vocabularies and scientific cultures make it difficult for individuals to find the latent connections between these two fields. Ontologies, controlled vocabularies with well-defined relations among terms, are a key tool in scientific data integration; by using ontologies, scientists from different disciplines can know when they are referring to the same entity by different names, and new discoveries are enabled by computer software being able to reason across disciplines and over large datasets.  Already widely used in genomics, ontologies are of growing importance in systematics, ecology, behavior, genetics, morphology and physiology.  This workshop aims to explore the utility of ontologies for ichthyology and herpetology, using the Teleost Anatomy Ontology and the Amphibian Anatomy Ontology as case studies of community resources that are being actively developed and used by members of ASIH.  Participants will present examples  of how these ontologies are being used to address novel research questions in the evolutionary of phenotype using model organism data, and to provide new ways of exploring data within morphological databases.

== Evolutionary Biology and Ontologies Workshop II: January 5, 2009 ==

This workshop will be held in conjunction with the [http://www.sicb.org/meetings/2009/ 2009 SICB Annual Meeting] in Boston, MA, in the morning of January 5, 2009. It is cosponsored by the [http://www.nescent.org National Evolutionary Synthesis Center] (NESCent) and the [http://bioontology.org National Center for Biomedical Ontologies] (NCBO).

; Organizers: Paula Mabee (U. South Dakota), Barry Smith (SUNY Buffalo), Todd Vision (UNC Chapel Hill, NESCent), Monte Westerfield (U. Oregon, ZFIN)

; Goals: The workshop is focused on the application of ontologies to studies in comparative biology, with a particular emphasis on morphological and behavioral phenotypes.  The goal is to introduce what ontologies are, how they are built, what makes an ontology useful, how ontologies can help researchers collaborate across disciplines, and to highlight several applications of this approach to comparative biology.

; Registration: Registration is open to attendees of the SICB 2009 conference at no additional cost.

== Evolutionary Biology and Ontologies Workshop I: June 20, 2008 ==

[[Image:Evolution2008-OntologyWorkshop.png|right]]
This workshop will be held in conjunction with the [http://www.cce.umn.edu/conferences/evolution/ Evolution 2008] meeting in Minneapolis, MN, 20 June 2008. It is organized under the auspices of the [http://ncbo.us National Center for Biomedical Ontologies] (NCBO) in collaboration with the [http://www.nescent.org/ National Evolutionary Synthesis Center] (NESCent).

; Organizers: Barry Smith (Buffalo), Paula Mabee (University of South Dakota), Todd Vision (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill), Monte Westerfield (University of Oregon)

; Focus: This meeting is focused on the application of ontologies to studies in evolutionary biology and related disciplines, with a particular emphasis on studies of the phenotype.

; Goals:
:# Introducing what ontologies are, how they should be built, what makes an ontology useful, and how ontologies help people collaborate across disciplines;
:# Giving illustrations of ontologies actually being used to address problems of interest to evolutionary biologists;
:# Networking and planning: what do we do next in order to advance ontology-based information integration in evolutionary biology?

; Registration: Registration will be open to attendees of the Evolution 2008 conference at no additional cost.

== First Morphology Data Jamboree: April 18-20, 2008 ==

The first Data Jamboree on Morpholoy with project personnel, affiliated ichthyologists and curators, and external advisors was held at NESCent on April 18-20, 2008.

== Needs Analysis Workshop: September 17-18, 2007 ==

The Needs Analysis Workshop brought together leading scientists from the fields of morphology, development, evolution, genetics, and ichthyology to identify driving biological research questions that take the most advantage of the evolutionary, anatomical, developmental, and genetics data that the Phenoscape will integrate. In particular, the workshop aimed to identify what informatic tools are needed in order to answer those questions. The workshop was held at NESCent on September 17-18, 2007.
