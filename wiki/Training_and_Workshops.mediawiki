== Evolutionary Biology and Ontologies Workshop: June 20, 2008 ==

[[Image:Evolution2008-OntologyWorkshop.png|right]]
This workshop will be held in conjunction with the [http://www.cce.umn.edu/conferences/evolution/ Evolution 2008] meeting in Minneapolis, MN, 20 June 2008. It is organized under the auspices of the [http://ncbo.us National Center for Biomedical Ontologies] (NCBO) in collaboration with the [http://www.nescent.org/ National Evolutionary Synthesis Center] (NESCent).

; Organizers: Barry Smith (Buffalo), Paula Mabee (University of South Dakota), Todd Vision (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill), Monte Westerfield (University of Oregon)

; Focus: This meeting is focused on the application of ontologies to studies in evolutionary biology and related disciplines, with a particular emphasis on studies of the phenotype.

; Goals:
:# Introducing what ontologies are, how they should be built, what makes an ontology useful, and how ontologies help people collaborate across disciplines;
:# Giving illustrations of ontologies actually being used to address problems of interest to evolutionary biologists;
:# Networking and planning: what do we do next in order to advance ontology-based information integration in evolutionary biology?

; Registration: Registration will be open to attendees of the Evolution 2008 conference at no additional cost.

There is also a [http://www.nescent.org/documents/EBO_Flyer.pdf  workshop flier] for dissemination. Please feel free to distribute the flier to your colleagues and students.
