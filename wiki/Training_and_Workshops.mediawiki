== Computable evolutionary phenotype knowledge: a hands-on workshop. Dec 11-14, 2017, Durham, NC ==

The Phenoscape project held a hands-on workshop on Dec 11-14, 2017, at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, to foster broader adoption, reuse, and interoperability of its flagship resource, the Phenoscape Knowledgebase (KB; http://kb.phenoscape.org). The KB offers programmable (API) access to natural language phenotype descriptions annotated with formal ontologies so that machines can understand and compute with the semantics of descriptions at scale. The API also provides online access to machine reasoning and other computational semantics algorithms for its data content, including synthesizing presence/absence character matrices, and finding evolutionary phenotype transitions semantically similar to gene phenotypes. The event brought together a diverse group of people to collaboratively design and work hands-on on targets of their interest that took advantage and promoted reuse of the KB’s data and services.

== Evolution 2017 SSB workshop – Trees, traits and functions: semantics for comparative biology ==

'''Day''': Friday, June 23, 2017<br/>
'''Time''': 1:30 PM - 5:00 PM<br/>
'''Location''': Oregon Convention Center, Portland, Rm. B114<br/>
''An optional pre-conference event. Prior registration required (during conference registration).''

Topic: A rich set of comparative phylogenetic methods has been developed in recent decades for the analysis of traits, functions, and other macroevolutionary patterns. A similarly rich set of tools, such as ontologies, data annotation models, and machine reasoners, have also recently been introduced allowing researchers to represent the semantics of phenotypes, traits, functions, and environmental properties in such a way that computers can access what had previously been the implicit knowledge of biological experts. Although these two efforts have remained largely separate from each other, a few studies at their intersection have shown that their synthesis has the potential to enable new classes of comparative analyses and provide an interdisciplinary bridge between different phylogenetics user communities. This symposium brings together research at the nexus of comparative phylogenetics and computable semantics of biological knowledge. The aim is to stimulate discussion and awareness of the opportunities that are emerging for the comparative biology community.

== Workshop on New Tools for Studying Phenotype Evolution in the Vertebrates, February 7-10, 2013==
What new research opportunities are opened up by the power to compute over phenotype information from thousands of species of vertebrates, together with phenotype and expression information for thousands of genes in multiple model organisms?  The first release of the Phenoscape Knowledgebase includes over 500K species phenotypes linked to 4,000+ genes from zebrafish, and is currently being extended to capture phenotype data from other vertebrates and linked to phenotype and expression data for other model organisms (including mouse and Xenopus).  Scientists were invited through an open call and invitations to participate in a workshop facilitated by [http://knowinnovation.com/ KnowInnovation], with the aim of initiating new collaborations to drive the development of the Phenoscape tool set/interface and present new and creative ways to deepen understanding of phenotypic evolution.  We were particularly interested in a broad approach to this problem and welcomed scientists with backgrounds in computational and systems biology, mathematics, development, genomics, and evolution.  Phenoscape is supporting the initial steps in projects that were the outcome of this successful workshop.  Supplemental funding for facilitation was generously awarded from the [http://www.nsf.gov/ National Science Foundation].  Funding for participation of ichthyologists in this workshop was provided by the [http://http://www.deepfin.org/ DeepFin Research Coordination Network].  Location: [http://www.calacademy.org/ California Academy of Sciences].  Organizers: David Blackburn, Paula Mabee and Todd Vision, together with KnowInnovation.

== [https://academy.nescent.org/wiki/Anatomy_ontologies Anatomy Ontology Summer Course]: July 30 to August 3, 2012 ==
A summer course on anatomy ontologies was offered in Durham NC, made possible by the NESCent Academy and the Phenotype Ontology Research Coordination Network.

== [[PATO workshop]]: September 25-27, 2010 ==
Members of Phenoscape met with personnel from the Hymenoptera Anatomy Ontology (HAO) project, TAIR and the Phenotype and Trait Ontology (PATO) at the University of Oregon to discuss and find solutions to reasoning issues that have arisen as a result of PATO ontology structure, and ways to represent phenotypes using the EQ model.

== [[Skeletal Anatomy Jamboree]]: April 9-10, 2010 ==

The meeting focused on re-evaluating the high-level skeletal system ontology hierarchy for fishes, particularly in relation to anatomy ontologies of other vertebrates. Participants re-examined existing terms and definitions (cells, tissues, development, anatomical structures) for their applicability across vertebrates, and discussed how to represent of bone development within the structurally-defined hierarchy.

== [[FMNH 2010 Workshop|Workshop @ The Field Museum]]: March 19, 2010 ==

The purpose of this meeting was outreach and training to local morphologists at the Field Museum and University of Chicago, informal usability testing of Phenoscape Knowledgebase interface, and to conduct a Phenoscape project meeting.

== [[ASIH09_workshop|Ontologies for Ichthyology and Herpetology: July 25, 2009]] ==

[[Image:asih2009ontologyworkshop.png]]

Organizers:
* Paula Mabee, Professor, Dept. of Biology, University of South Dakota
* Anne Maglia, Professor, Missouri University of Science and Technology
* Todd Vision, Assistant Director, National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NESCent) and Associate Professor, Dept. of Biology, University of North Carolina
* Monte Westerfield, Director, Zebrafish Information Network and Professor, Institute of Neuroscience, University of Oregon

The aim of this workshop to promote the integration of ichtyological and herpetological data with genetic, genomic, and developmental data for the purposes of understanding the genetic basis for phenotypic variation and diversification.  The focus will be on major anatomical ontology efforts already underway in these organisms, and their use within new and existing morphological databases.

While knowledge from model organism biology can inform our understanding of natural phenotypic variation and evolution, differing vocabularies and scientific cultures make it difficult for individuals to find the latent connections between these two fields. Ontologies, controlled vocabularies with well-defined relations among terms, are a key tool in scientific data integration; by using ontologies, scientists from different disciplines can know when they are referring to the same entity by different names, and new discoveries are enabled by computer software being able to reason across disciplines and over large datasets.  Already widely used in genomics, ontologies are of growing importance in systematics, ecology, behavior, genetics, morphology and physiology.  This workshop aims to explore the utility of ontologies for ichthyology and herpetology, using the Teleost Anatomy Ontology and the Amphibian Anatomy Ontology as case studies of community resources that are being actively developed and used by members of ASIH.  Participants will present examples  of how these ontologies are being used to address novel research questions in the evolutionary of phenotype using model organism data, and to provide new ways of exploring data within morphological databases.
