title: Phenoscape KB
---

The Phenoscape Knowledgebase (KB) is an integrated dataset, and software infrastructure and services, bringing together evolutionary data matrices annotated by Phenoscape curators, model organism phenotype and gene expression annotations, and a collection of ontologies providing a common semantic framework. The entire dataset is expressed in the OWL Web Ontology Language, and, when used as a database, stored in an RDF triplestore.

''This page describes the in-development version of the KB built on OWL and RDF technologies, not the legacy Phenoscape Knowledgebase built on OBD.''
