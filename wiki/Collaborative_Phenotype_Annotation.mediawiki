title: Collaborative Phenotype Annotation
---

== Requirements ==

A [https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=196B6ggDem43q_RXuONK6s1_ziT-At8m_Jz1nVLJdHEc requirements and priorities document] is in development and being reviewed by stakeholders.

== Technology options ==

=== MX ===
====Requirements from Phenoscape I curation workflow (that are expected to carry forward)====
* import matrix data from file source (usually NEXUS)
** ''Supported. Can import character and state labels, matrix data from a NEXUS file. This is a one-time import before editing in MX.''
* hold a reference to a publication as the source for the matrix
** ''Supported. Has a module for maintaining references (publications) which can be used throughout the system. References can be used to tag several different types of data in the system.''
* view and edit matrix
** ''Supported. Several different matrix viewing and editing modes. Subsets of the matrix can be given a label and viewed/edited. In MX all the characters and OTUs constitute one global matrix - a labelled matrix is an arbitrary view into this big matrix via a specific list of characters and OTUs.''
* free text entry for characters and character states for a matrix
** ''Supported.''
* free text entry for OTUs
** ''Supported.''
* annotate OTUs with taxonomy ontology ID
** ''Not directly supported. There is a taxonomy module which OTUs can reference. However for Phenoscape needs we would probably implement a separate ontology/controlled vocabulary field for OTUs.''
* add specimens for each OTU, select museum code from ontology
** ''Supported but complex. MX has a pretty comprehensive specimen management module. However it is much more complex than that in Phenex.''
* ontology term autocomplete for term input
** ''Supported, via Bioportal data services. However the EQ entry form is being updated and is somewhat in flux at the moment.''
* term info panel for terms selected in autocomplete
** ''Not supported - would require implementation. A trivial but somewhat lacking implementation could provide a link in MX that would pop open the Bioportal term info page.''
* ontology tree browsing panel or linkout to term in BioPortal tree view
** ''Not supported - would require implementation. A trivial implementation could provide a link in MX that would pop open the Bioportal term info page.''
* output to Excel report - consistency review; author page
** ''Not supported - would require implementation. Could be nicely implemented as a public-viewable web page in MX.''
* output to KB - currently requires NeXML
** ''Not completely supported. An OWL output format exists which could be the basis for output to future revisions of the KB based on OWL technology.''

====Requirements expected to newly arise (or arise at a more demanding level) in Phenoscape II====
* Integrate with ORB:
** request temporary term
*** ''Needs implementation - straightforward.''
** check temporary terms for official ID
*** ''Needs implementation - could be periodically run in the background and the database updated directly.''
** use previously requested temporary terms in data
*** ''Needs implementation. Could be per project (fish, amphibians, etc.)''
* Improved UI usability:
** UI (data entry) and data model (OWL output) support for pre-configured frequently occurring types of characters (such as presence/absence (neomorphic), qualitative, count, relative phenotype)
*** ''Support for character types has been implemented; however after user experience with the initial version a complete revision is planned (and is beginning very soon).''
** as few clicks as possible for reaching features for composing annotations
*** ''The current implementation provides a link next to a term field which pops open a post-composition window.''
** avoid right-clicks where possible
*** ''Right-clicks are not used in the interface.''
** ability to attach images to character states or entities
*** ''MX supports tagging of almost anything with images/figures.''
** interface that unifies access to pdfs, svn, matrix editor, orb, etc.
*** ''Currently supports storage of PDFs with refs, matrix editing. ORB can be implemented. SVN would not be necessary with shared database.''
* Support collaborative phenotype annotation
** real-time teaching of the curation tool, practices, and results to project curators
*** Web-based implementation would facilitate remote collaboration.
** simultaneous editing of different parts of single data matrix
*** ''Supported well due to web-based implementation.''
** ability to edit a data matrix without regard to current activities of other editors
*** ''Supported well due to web-based implementation.''
** ability to tie into real-time collaborative editing frameworks (such as Google’s upcoming one, codenamed BRIX)
*** ''Unlikely to be practical.''
** ability to share pdfs
*** ''Supported in reference module.''
* Support annotation of homology
** ''Not supported - could be developed fairly easily but would be its own new module.''
** evidence codes
*** ''Not supported but straightforward.''
** attribution
*** ''Not supported but straightforward.''
* Facilitate wider use and adoption
** easy tool deployment to users, including software updates
*** ''Web-based application does not need to be installed by users; always up-to-date.''
** easy deposition of annotation output to a shared repository
*** ''Would need to be developed for whatever format is required.''
** easy digitization of the published matrices
*** ''Unsure of meaning.''
** minimize or ideally obviate the need for maintaining 3rd party software dependencies (such as Mesquite, or SVN tools)
*** ''SVN no longer needed. Mesquite might be needed for initial massaging of original NEXUS files.''
** support for deposition into TreeBASE
*** ''Not currently supported - an output format would need development.''

====Requirements from Phenoscape I curation workflow (that are expected to carry forward)====
* import matrix data from file source (usually NEXUS)
** ''Supported. Can import character and state labels, matrix data from a NEXUS file. This is a one-time import before editing in Phenex.''
* hold a reference to a publication as the source for the matrix
** ''Supported. A PSPUB ID must be entered in a text field. The PSPUB IDs are stored in a separate Endnote file maintained in SVN.''
* view and edit matrix
** ''Supported.''
* free text entry for characters and character states for a matrix
** ''Supported.''
* free text entry for OTUs
** ''Supported.''
* annotate OTUs with taxonomy ontology ID
** ''Supported.''
* add specimens for each OTU, select museum code from ontology
** ''Supported.''
* ontology term autocomplete for term input
** ''Supported.''
* term info panel for terms selected in autocomplete
** ''Supported. Immediately updates as terms are selected in autocomplete menu.''
* ontology tree browsing panel or linkout to term in BioPortal tree view
** ''Supported. Built-in to app, along with various OBO-Edit ontology views.''
* output to Excel report - consistency review; author page
** ''Supported.''
* output to KB - currently requires NeXML
** ''Supported. Will need update for future KB revisions based on OWL technology for proper presence/absence modeling, etc.''

====Requirements expected to newly arise (or arise at a more demanding level) in Phenoscape II====
* Integrate with ORB:
** request temporary term
*** ''Needs implementation - straightforward.''
** check temporary terms for official ID
*** ''Needs implementation - could occur on user request or when files are opened.''
** use previously requested temporary terms in data
*** ''Needs implementation - would probably be per user.''
* Improved UI usability:
** UI (data entry) and data model (OWL output) support for pre-configured frequently occurring types of characters (such as presence/absence (neomorphic), qualitative, count, relative phenotype)
*** ''Not supported - EQ interface and data model would need to be reimplemented.''
** as few clicks as possible for reaching features for composing annotations
*** ''Cell must be double-clicked to edit, right-clicked for post-composition.''
** avoid right-clicks where possible
*** ''Post-composition right-click could be removed if a button were added to each cell - moderately complicated in Phenex.''
** ability to attach images to character states or entities
*** ''Not supported. Easy to add if just need to paste an image URL in a field. Showing images would require moderate amount of development.''
** interface that unifies access to pdfs, svn, matrix editor, orb, etc.
*** ''Not really feasible to integrate all of this into Phenex. Would continue to use external SVN application; probably also external reference management.''
* Support collaborative phenotype annotation
** real-time teaching of the curation tool, practices, and results to project curators
*** ''Would require screen-sharing - not directly possible.''
** simultaneous editing of different parts of single data matrix
*** ''Only possible via SVN file merges - kind of risky.''
** ability to edit a data matrix without regard to current activities of other editors
*** ''Only possible via SVN file merges - kind of risky.''
** ability to tie into real-time collaborative editing frameworks (such as Google’s upcoming one, codenamed BRIX)
*** ''Practically impossible.''
** ability to share pdfs
*** ''Not supported.''
* Support annotation of homology
** ''Currently done in a separate Phenote application. Could be added to Phenex, but this functionality is completely independent of the data matrix core of Phenex.''
** evidence codes
*** ''Supported in Phenote.''
** attribution
*** ''Supported in Phenote.''
* Facilitate wider use and adoption
** easy tool deployment to users, including software updates
*** ''Requires download of new versions and manual replacement.''
** easy deposition of annotation output to a shared repository
*** ''Supported via SVN for data files. KB imports these directly.''
** easy digitization of the published matrices
*** ''Unsure of meaning.''
** minimize or ideally obviate the need for maintaining 3rd party software dependencies (such as Mesquite, or SVN tools)
** support for deposition into TreeBASE
*** ''Not directly supported - does TreeBASE support NeXML deposition?''

==Original basic overview comparison==

=== MX ===
The [http://mx.phenomix.org/index.php/Main_Page MX web application] is being enhanced with features for EQ annotation of character matrix data. Phenoscape may be interested in adopting this system for data curation. This page collects a list of pros and cons to help decide whether to adopt the MX web application or continue using the [[Phenex]] desktop software.

'''Pros:'''
* web based, central database
** easy collaboration
** record of who changed what
** latest application version always running
* many other features besides EQ annotation
* easy to create new pages displaying various reports using data
* initial development of phenotype categories for EQ
* unify more of Jim's effort

'''Cons''':
* many other features besides EQ annotation
* missing ontology visualization tools
* EQ interface in flux - not quite ready for primetime
* requires internet connection
* output format suitable for KB ingestion must be coded
* reliance on BioPortal web services for ontology data
* less independence for anonymous user - requires server management, project accounts

=== [[Phenex]] ===
'''Pros''':
* outputs files ready for KB; workflow in place
* integrates OBO-Edit code for ontology visualization and query
* "simple", targeted interface
* easy to point to customized versions of ontologies

'''Cons''':
* less flexible interface
* requires use of version control system for collaboration
* tightly coupled to OBO format
* updates must be manually downloaded and installed
