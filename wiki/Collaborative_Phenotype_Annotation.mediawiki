title: Collaborative Phenotype Annotation
---

The [http://mx.phenomix.org/index.php/Main_Page MX web application] is being enhanced with features for EQ annotation of character matrix data. Phenoscape may be interested in adopting this system for data curation. This page collects a list of pros and cons to help decide whether to adopt the MX web application or continue using the Phenex desktop software.

==MX pros==
* web based, central database
** easy collaboration
** record of who changed what
** latest application version always running
* many other features besides EQ annotation
* easy to create new pages displaying various reports using data
* initial development of phenotype categories for EQ
* unify more of Jim's effort

==MX cons==
* many other features besides EQ annotation
* missing ontology visualization tools
* EQ interface in flux - not quite ready for primetime
* requires internet connection
* output format suitable for KB ingestion must be coded
* reliance on BioPortal web services for ontology data
* less independence for anonymous user - requires server management, project accounts


==Phenex pros==
* outputs files ready for KB; workflow in place
* integrates OBO-Edit code for ontology visualization and query
* "simple", targeted interface
* easy to point to customized versions of ontologies


==Phenex cons==
* less flexible interface
* requires use of version control system for collaboration
* tightly coupled to OBO format
* updates must be manually downloaded and installed
