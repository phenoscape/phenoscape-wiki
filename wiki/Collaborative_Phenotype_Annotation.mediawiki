title: Collaborative Phenotype Annotation
---

== Requirements ==

A [https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=196B6ggDem43q_RXuONK6s1_ziT-At8m_Jz1nVLJdHEc requirements and priorities document] is in development and being reviewed by stakeholders.

== Technology options ==

=== MX ===
====Requirements from Phenoscape I curation workflow (that are expected to carry forward)====
* import matrix data from file source (usually NEXUS)
** ''Can import character and state labels, matrix data from a NEXUS file. This is a one-time import before editing in MX.''
* hold a reference to a publication as the source for the matrix
** ''Has a module for maintaining references (publications) which can be used throughout the system. References can be used to tag several different types of data in the system.''
* view and edit matrix
** ''Several different matrix viewing and editing modes. Subsets of the matrix can be given a label and viewed/edited. In MX all the characters and OTUs constitute one global matrix - a labelled matrix is an arbitrary view into this big matrix via a specific list of characters and OTUs.''
* free text entry for characters and character states for a matrix
* free text entry for OTUs
* annotate OTUs with taxonomy ontology ID
* add specimens for each OTU, select museum code from ontology
* ontology term autocomplete for term input
* term info panel for terms selected in autocomplete
* ontology tree browsing panel or linkout to term in BioPortal tree view
* output to Excel report - consistency review; author page
* output to KB - currently requires NeXML

====Requirements expected to newly arise (or arise at a more demanding level) in Phenoscape II====
* Integrate with ORB:
** request temporary term
** check temporary terms for official ID
** use previously requested temporary terms in data
* Improved UI usability:
** UI (data entry) and data model (OWL output) support for pre-configured frequently occurring types of characters (such as presence/absence (neomorphic), qualitative, count, relative phenotype)
** as few clicks as possible for reaching features for composing annotations
** avoid right-clicks where possible
** ability to attach images to character states or entities
** interface that unifies access to pdfs, svn, matrix editor, orb, etc.
* Support collaborative phenotype annotation
** real-time teaching of the curation tool, practices, and results to project curators
** simultaneous editing of different parts of single data matrix
** ability to edit a data matrix without regard to current activities of other editors
** ability to tie into real-time collaborative editing frameworks (such as Google’s upcoming one, codenamed BRIX)
** ability to share pdfs
* Support annotation of homology
** evidence codes
** attribution
* Facilitate wider use and adoption
** easy tool deployment to users, including software updates
** easy deposition of annotation output to a shared repository
** easy digitization of the published matrices
** minimize or ideally obviate the need for maintaining 3rd party software dependencies (such as Mesquite, or SVN tools)
** support for deposition into TreeBASE
