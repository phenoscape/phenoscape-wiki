=== Genus differentia definition ===
Textual term definitions facilitate the consistent use of a term in annotation of different data types by curators. We follow the convention that each term should have a textual definition of the genus-differentia form (i.e., a subclass structure of A is an A that has properties X and Y that distinguish it from the other subclass structures of A (Smith et al. 2007). Distinguishing characteristics typically include structural criteria, location, shape, development and/or a list of the parts of the entity.

The following are examples of genus-differentia definitions in the TAO. Note that the definition begins with the name of the parent term ("dermal bone") followed by the characteristics that differentiate the defined term from all other dermal 

'''Antorbital''': Dermal bone that is located on the anterior margin of the infraorbital series, dorsal to the first infraorbital and lateral to the nasal 
'''Dentary''': Dermal bone that forms the anterolateral part of the lower jaw.

Comments: Taxonomic statements to be applied to a structure, which are not universals, are recorded in the comment field for that term. For example, Weberian apparatus (TAO: 0001188 ) has the following definition: “Anatomical cluster that consists of the modified anteriormost vertebrae and associated structures that connect the swim bladder to the inner ear.,” and the following is recorded in the comment field: “Vertebra 1-4, and sometimes vertebra 5 in some catfishes, are part of the Weberian apparatus. Weberian apparatus is present in Otophysi.” Here the statements about components of the Weberian apparatus do not universally apply to all teleosts, but is included in the comment field because this information is potentially helpful to the ontology user for general understanding and for identifying structures.
