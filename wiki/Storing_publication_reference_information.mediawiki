title: Storing publication reference information
---

==Problem==
It would be simplest to store references to articles as an ID number which can be looked up elsewhere.  Here are some possibilities in order of preference:

# DOI or Handle (*)
# Pubmed ID (**)
# SICI numbers, if the publisher uses it for a stable URL
# Biodiversity Heritage Library URL of the article
# constructed SICI ID (***)

(*) I doubt that there are articles with both a DOI *and* a handle, but if you encounter one, use the DOI.

(**) There aren't many articles with Pubmed ID that lack a DOI, but it's possible for pre-1998 pubs.
