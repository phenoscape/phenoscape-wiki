title: Storing publication reference information
---

==Problem==
It would be simplest to store references to articles as an ID number which can be looked up elsewhere.  Here are some possibilities in order of preference:

# DOI or Handle (*)
# Pubmed ID (**)
# SICI numbers, if the publisher uses it for a stable URL
# Biodiversity Heritage Library URL of the article
# constructed SICI ID (***,****)
# constructed [[OpenURL]]

(*) I doubt that there are articles with both a DOI *and* a handle, but if you encounter one, use the DOI. There is a text query interface to look up DOI at CrossRef: http://www.crossref.org/SimpleTextQuery/

For most articles earlier than 1997 there almost certainly won't be a DOI. Try JSTOR and use their SICI-based link but the best way for those that can't be readily assigned an identifier is to enter the complete citation.

(**) There aren't many articles with Pubmed ID that lack a DOI, but it's possible for pre-1998 pubs.

(***) Jim & Hilmar looking into interface to help do this

(****) Requires ISSN for construction, won't work for book sections
