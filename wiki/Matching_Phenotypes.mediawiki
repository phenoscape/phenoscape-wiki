---

This page discusses the method developed and implemented in late 2010 for search for, and scoring, phenotype matches between taxa (Phenoscape) and zebrafish mutants (ZFIN).
= Purpose =

= Selecting Phenotypes from Taxon Annotations =

= Using attributes to limit the scope of quality comparisons =

Each phenotype is linked to multiple entities via ''inheres_in_part_of'' relations.

= Scoring matches of individual phenotypes =

= Scoring matches of sets of phenotypes (phenotypic profiles) associated with a gene or taxon node =
