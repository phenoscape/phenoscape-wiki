= Matching Phenotypes represented using EQs =

== Why? ==

== Selecting Phenotypes from Taxon Annotations ==

== Using attributes to limit the scope of quality comparisons ==

== Scoring matches of individual phenotypes ==

== Scoring matches of sets of phenotypes (phenotypic profiles) associated with a gene or taxon node ==
