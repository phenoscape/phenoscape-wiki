---

The following are instructions on how to update a taxon list after you have received an email from a student informing you that the taxon list for a particular publication was completed, and needs an update for taxonomy.

====Download the taxon file from the phenoscape-fileshare====
(ask a PhenoScaper for username and password)

On a Mac, go to the Finder and Go > Connect to Server.  Type this in the Server Address:  https://webdav.nescent.org/phenoscape-data/
Use Finder to navigate to the folder called "Taxon lists (phenote+)."  Find the relevant taxon list for your work, and copy to a location on your computer. 

On a PC, ??

After connecting to the server, navigate to the Taxon List (phenote+) folder and copy the file to your desktop.

====Open file in Phenote+====

Make sure that you have an internet connection before starting Phenote+ as the software will need to download updated ontology files when available.

Start up Phenote+ (click "Update All" if the update panel appears) and check that you are using the Taxon configuration of Phenote (to check, go to Settings>Set Configuration, and confirm that ‘phenoscape_taxon’ is chosen. You may need to restart Phenote+ for the configuration to appear).

Open the taxon file using File>Open.
