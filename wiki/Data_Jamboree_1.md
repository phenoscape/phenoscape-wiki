## Location and Date

**Venue:** National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NESCent)
(<span class="plainlinks">[directions](http://www.nescent.org/about/directions.php)</span>,

visitors](http://www.nescent.org/about/information.php)</span>)

**Date:** April 18-20, 2008

**Organizers:** Paula Mabee, Monte Westerfield, Todd Vision, and Hilmar
Lapp

## Introduction

We have developed the software tools to input systematic character data
in a formalized way to a degree that we have started to enter
species-level as well as some of the higher level taxonomic characters
(e.g. from Fink & Fink, 1981). This workshop brings together
morphologists from the community of ichthyologists and project personnel
focused on morphology, taxonomy, data curation, ontology curation, and
informatics. The workshop will introduce ichthyologists to the approach,
and pair morphologists from the community with project personnel to work
one-on-one on entering published systematic character data.

The hands-on curation work at the jamboree will almost certainly reveal
ontological issues, such as terminology and synonymies, issues in
annotation consistency or workflow, as well as usability and data flow
issues involving the software tools. These will help drive the
development of the database and web-based interfaces, but will also spur
further development of the involved ontologies and refinement of the
annotation procedures. The informatics as well as ontology personnel of
the project will be on hand to respond to the issues on the spot.

Finally, the workshop will also provide a very interesting opportunity
to brainstorm about the informatics tools and data required to push
beyond current limits, thus fostering new discoveries at the interface
between evolution and developmental genetics.

## Agenda

The Jamboree will start in the morning (~9am) on Friday, April 18, and
continue through noon on Sunday, April 20. Non-project participants will
arrive on Thursday, April 17, and depart in the afternoon of April 20.
