== Resources for Constructing a Vertebrate Taxonomy Ontology ==

There are two types of resources useful for building taxonomic ontologies: taxonomic resources which provide hierarchy and nomenclature resources which provide information about names.  Both types of resources are used in taxonomic ontologies and listed here.

=== Fish ===

The TTO is derived from the catalog of fishes, which provides some taxonomy information and a great deal of nomenclature in the form of synonyms.  It is updated several times a year and TTO should be rebuilt by requesting the appropriate files from Stan Blum.

The TTO also incorporates some common names from Fishbase and cross references (xrefs) from the Global Names Index.

Information for extinct taxa has been added as needed by curation, and the taxonomy is, as a rule, from the curated publication.

=== Amphibians ===

The ATO is derived from the AmphibiaWeb list, which provides both taxonomy and some synonyms from ITIS and ???.

=== Non-avian Diapsids (aka Reptiles) ===

Although ??? provides
