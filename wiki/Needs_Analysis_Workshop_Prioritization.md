- Other data types or dimensions we haven't looked at
  - Time: e.g., developmental time-series
  - Geography
- Abilities to restrict traits by
  - high-level character modules
  - gene
  - GO
  - location
  - developmental stage
  - availability of sufficient data

### Prioritization

<figcaption>Priorities</figcaption>
</figure>

- Character mapping on trees
- Correlation matrix of traits
- Downloadable reports of query results (e.g. candidate genes;
  comparative phenotypic data)
- Identifying clades which traits vary (quick retrieval of character
  state distributions)
- Phenotypic BLAST to discover similar phenotypes and similar OTUs
- Discovery of genetic or evolutionary modules
- Integrating genetic data

### Visualizations:

- body map
- filtering options
- visualizing the ontology
- external data types, link-out to NCBI
