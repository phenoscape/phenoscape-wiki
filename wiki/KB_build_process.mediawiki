title: KB build process

The Phenoscape KB build process goes through several steps in converting input data sources to a queryable knowledgebase. This page provides some description for each of the steps.

==OWL conversion==
The Phenoscape Knowledgebase works as a single unified OWL model. While some inputs (e.g. the shared ontologies such as [http://uberon.org/ Uberon] and [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/pato PATO]) are natively distributed as OWL documents, others are converted to OWL from some other representation.

==Identifier cleanup==

==Axiom generation==

==Materialization of inferred axioms==

==Assertion of absence hierarchy==
