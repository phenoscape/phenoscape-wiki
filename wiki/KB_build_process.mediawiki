title: KB build process
---

The Phenoscape KB build process goes through several steps in converting input data sources to a queryable knowledgebase. This page provides some description for each of the steps, most or all of which are implemented in the [https://github.com/phenoscape/phenoscape-owl-tools phenoscape-owl-tools] project.

==OWL conversion==
The Phenoscape Knowledgebase works as a single unified OWL model. While some inputs (e.g. the shared ontologies such as [http://uberon.org/ Uberon] and [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/pato PATO]) are natively distributed as OWL documents, others are converted to OWL from some other representation.

==Axiom generation==

==Materialization of inferred axioms==
