title: KB build process
---

The Phenoscape KB build process goes through several steps in converting input data sources to a queryable knowledgebase. This page provides some description for each of the steps, most or all of which are implemented in the [https://github.com/phenoscape/phenoscape-owl-tools phenoscape-owl-tools] project.

==OWL conversion==
The Phenoscape Knowledgebase works as a single unified OWL model. While some inputs (e.g. the shared ontologies such as [http://uberon.org/ Uberon] and [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/pato PATO]) are natively distributed as OWL documents, others are converted to OWL from some other representation. In doing so the inputs are, as far as possible, converted to a shared data model. EQ annotations are converted to a specific semantic representation.

==Identifier cleanup==
Several standard OWL properties (part_of, has_part, develops_from, etc.) are conceptually shared across ontology and annotation resources, facilitating data integration. However, unlike class identifiers, identifiers for properties are often not standardized and they may not properly reference shared terms (usually because of poor tool support rather than user intent). 

==Axiom generation==

==Materialization of inferred axioms==

==Assertion of absence hierarchy==
