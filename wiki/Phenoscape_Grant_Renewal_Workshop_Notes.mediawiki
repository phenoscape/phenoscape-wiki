title: Phenoscape Grant Renewal Workshop/Notes
---

== Wednesday afternooon ==

* Will be extending the taxonomic scope to extant and extinct vertebrates
** Create an annotation database spanning the taxonomic scope and their anatomy ontologies
** Three multi-species anatomy ontologies are being developed: teleosts, amphibians, mammalian anatomy
** Tree mapping: show when an evolutionary phenotype first appeared
* EQ support in all involved model organism databases
** Structure of MP is not consistent with anatomy, or with PATO
** Mapping from MP to EQ syntax is being worked on
** MGI isn't in a position to use EQ internally, but for example Phenoscape could provide an EQ-view on mouse phenotypes, using the decomposition of MP into anatomy (or entity) and quality term cross-product
** Full EQ annotation for OMIM is being planned but not yet funded
** MGI, Xenbase, and ZFIN all have links from their phenotype data to OMIM
* Development of anatomy
** Different approaches between MGI and ZFIN:
*** MGI uses complete anatomy at different developmental stages
*** ZFIN uses one anatomy ontology and adds start and end dates to indicate the developmental period during which it appears (adult structures don't have an end date)
*** Xenbase uses the ZFIN approach
** Candidate genes for evolutionary change could be derived from anatomy-annotated gene expression studies during development
*** genes responsible for or associated with morphological changes during individual development could be candidates for evolutionary change
*** evolutionary phenotype changes could be used to query morphological changes during development
** Can we enable queries to generate hyptheses based on ontogeny reflecting evolutionary history?
*** Evolutionary developmental data could come from medaka, stickleback
* Sequence of steps:
*# Ontology building
*#* Adult phenotype annotations for mutants in Xenbase
*#* Presently only 3 species for amphibians: Xenopus, Dermophis, Salamandria
*#* Development decoupling from anatomy ontology in mouse
*#* Expanding mammalian anatomy to include extinct species
*#* Anatomy for amniotes (the clade including mouse and dinosaurs), including extinct taxa (such as dinosaurs)
*#** Scope of this could be overwhelming
*#** Should be strongly driven (or staged) according to the character matrices to be annotated
*#** Chicken anatomy could provide a starting point?
*#** There is work on bird anatomy that uses a latin naming scheme
*#** Work on any smaller-scope anatomy (or multi-species anatomy) ontology will contribute terms that apply more broadly
*#** There may not be very many neomorphs between birds and mammals, though there are a few areas such as the digits in birds where the exact homology relationships aren't as clearly agreed upon.
*# Mammalian phenotype decomposition
*#* Need support for QC'ing the results of automated decomposition
*#* Alignment of MP with mouse anatomy
*# Annotation
*#* Which published character matrices are there for dinosaurs?
* Ontology mapping and alignment
** Need to align teleost and amphibian anatomy to mouse.
** Mouse and chicken need to be mapped to amniote anatomy. Mouse is a better start because there are genetic data.
* Reconciling character-derived trees and character definition and use between different matrices and trees that share taxa (Paul)
** [http://taxonsearch.org TaxonSearch]
** Formalizing and generating grammar of character coding and character state definition
** Analyzing character usage (shared, not shared, rejected) between trees that share taxa
** Conflicting phylogenies for the same set of taxa often turn out to be based on character codings that are not consistent or not compatible
