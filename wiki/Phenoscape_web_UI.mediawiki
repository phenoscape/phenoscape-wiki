Phenoscape web UI development plan.

==2009==
===February 2009===
*Mockup changes to existing interfaces required to incorporate 1/5/09 team feedback on existing interface components
* Taxon search interface '''Done'''
** Mockup interface using dummy data within web application - request group feedback
*** Front page search interface and results table - may include intermediate results summary page
* Interface demo and feedback session - DECAP meeting, Feb. 27, 2009 '''Done'''
** Present screenshots and mockups
** Possible live demo depending on data service performance progress
*** Services should return in no more than 2 seconds
*** Evaluate feasibility 2 weeks before meeting
* Mockup publication data interface within web application '''Done'''
* Mockup "splashy" search entry page - we should have a more graphically capturing entry gateway for exploring the data content
** One of the following:
***Hierarchical term explorer
***Visual explorer, using schematic drawings ("the prototypical fish")
***Visual explorer using 3D scans of catfish (and eventually zebrafish when done).
**Should explore various prototypes of these ideas using HTML mockups and get feedback from project team
* Mockup taxonomy-based tree-mapped data perspective
** View taxonomic phenotype annotation results organized by a phylogenetic tree
** Group phenotypes as simplistic union of descendant nodes, rather than ancestral reconstruction
** Use taxonomy as basis for phylogenetic tree
**Develop HTML mockups in web application

===March 2009===
* Incorporate 1/5/09 team feedback on existing interface components '''In progress'''
** Anatomy term search results - reorganize according to [[:Image:Phenotype_search_page_mockup.jpg|sketch]]
** Gene search results - reorganize according to [[:Image:Gene_search_page_mockup.jpg|sketch]]
** Taxonomic phenotype results page - add Order column for taxonomic grouping
** Present various phenotypic results grouped by custom "character slim" done
*** Requires slim development by team members (Wasila, Paula) Done--[[User:Pmabee@usd.edu|Pmabee@usd.edu]] 12:20, 20 March 2009 (EDT)done and service implementation by Cartik
* Taxon search interface
** Design data service schema to be implemented by Cartik
** Implement interface using live data service once developed by Cartik

===April 2009===
* Implement "splashy" search entry page as defined by mockup work
* Incorporate publication data into user interface
** Incorporate publication links into annotation results displays
*** Columns referencing numbers of taxonomic phenotype or mutant phenotype match results will be accompanied by a column including number of publications referencing the search item
*** Link from publication count to a publication listing
** Publication listing includes brief citation each of which links to a publication detail page
** Publication detail page(s)
*** Full citation information
*** Display curator credits
*** Display or link to original matrix including free-text data and specimen listing
*** Display or link to all phenotype annotations resulting from publication
** Requires publication data implementation in OBD by Cartik
** Requires specimen data implementation in OBD by Cartik
* Possible user testing session in conjunction with RCN meeting at NESCent

===May 2009===
* Implement taxonomy-based tree-mapped data perspective
*Implement appropriate scalable deployment of web application '''Done'''
**Multiple application instances and load balancing '''Done'''

===Release candidate - June 2009===
*Project team testing
*Bug fixes
*Overall performance evaluation

===Public launch: ASIH meeting, Portland, Oregon - July 22, 2009===

==2010==
===February 2010===
* Develop overall site revision plan based on feedback from Knowledgebase Beta 1 interface '''[Done]'''
* Knowledgebase 2.0 site revision mockup testing '''[Done]'''
** Present mockups to naive users in Eugene, Oregon, February 16-17 ['''Done''']
** Revise mockups using testing session user feedback ['''Done''']
* Develop 2.0-beta implementation plans with feedback from Phenoscape stakeholders ['''Deferred''']

===March 2010===
* Annotation search results pages with editable data filters
* Working taxonomy cladogram data interfaces
* Complete mockups of advanced query interfaces
* Phenoscape meeting at Field Museum, Chicago
** Conduct user feedback sessions with mockups of forthcoming interfaces, and live testing of implemented pages ['''Done''']
** Write-up results of feedback and proposed changes
* Generate permanent unique ID for each publication ['''Done''']
* Enter unique IDs for publications into Endnote ['''Done''']
* Data imported KB via Endnote XML files [NOTE: This part was done quite a while ago. However, a slight modification needs to be made to use the new unique IDs for publications]
** citation information as individual semantic pieces (individual authors, title, journal, etc.) - ['''Deprioritized''']
** abstract
** DOI if available
* Investigate importing previous names of ZFIN genes
* Gene symbol as primary name - [NOTE: This was the old status quo before we decided to the display the complete name of the gene, can easily revert to this.]

===April 2010===
* Term search results pages incorporating ontology tree browser
* Publication pages with citation and abstract, links to publications from other data types
* Advanced query interface, data download implementation
* type of mutation/defect producing phenotype result (requires feasibility investigation)
* ZFIN publication ID for each phenotype annotation
* import common names for taxa

===May 2010===
* Publication pages with data matrix (table view and downloadable)
* Publication pages with specimens
* Link to taxonomy cladogram interfaces via data on other pages
* Official release of Phenoscape Knowledgebase 2.0-beta

===June 2010===
* User testing sessions of Knowledgebase 2.0-beta
* Bug and feedback revisions

===July 2010===
* Official release of Phenoscape Knowledgebase 2.0
