title: Phenoscape web UI

==Development Roadmap==
===February 2009===
* Incorporate 1/5/09 team feedback on existing interface components
** Anatomy term search results - reorganize according to [[:Image:Phenotype_search_page_mockup.jpg|sketch]]
** Gene search results - reorganize according to [[:Image:Gene_search_page_mockup.jpg|sketch]]
** Taxonomic phenotype results page - add Order column for taxonomic grouping
** Present various phenotypic results grouped by custom "character slim"
*** Requires slim development by team members (Wasila, Paula) and service implementation by Cartik
* Taxon search interface
** Mockup interface using dummy data within web application - request group feedback
*** Front page search interface and results table - may include intermediate results summary page
** Design data service schema to be implemented by Cartik
** Implement using live data service once developed by Cartik
* Interface demo and feedback session - DECAP meeting, Feb. 27, 2009
** Present screenshots and mockups
** Possible live demo depending on data service performance progress
*** Services should return in no more than 2 seconds
*** Evaluate feasibility 2 weeks before meeting

===March 2009===
* Mockup publication data interface within web application ''-- should these mockups be available for DECAP meeting in February?''
* Incorporate publication data into user interface
** Incorporate publication links into annotation results displays
*** Columns referencing numbers of taxonomic phenotype or mutant phenotype match results will be accompanied by a column including number of publications referencing the search item
*** Link from publication count to a publication listing
** Publication listing includes brief citation each of which links to a publication detail page
** Publication detail page(s)
*** Full citation information
*** Display curator credits
*** Display or link to original matrix including free-text data and specimen listing
*** Display or link to all phenotype annotations resulting from publication
** Requires publication data implementation in OBD by Cartik
** Requires specimen data implementation in OBD by Cartik

===April 2009===
* "Splashy" search entry page - we should have a more graphically capturing entry gateway for exploring the data content
** One of the following:
***Hierarchical term explorer
***Visual explorer, using schematic drawings ("the prototypical fish")
***Visual explorer using 3D scans of catfish (and eventually zebrafish when done).
**Should explore various prototypes of these ideas using HTML mockups and get feedback from project team
**Implement preferred interface
* Possible user testing session in conjunction with RCN meeting at NESCent

===May 2009===
* Taxonomy-based tree-mapped data perspective
** View taxonomic phenotype annotation results organized by a phylogenetic tree
** Group phenotypes as simplistic union of descendant nodes, rather than ancestral reconstruction
** Use taxonomy as basis for phylogenetic tree
**Develop HTML mockups in web application
** Implement based on project team feedback

===Release candidate - June 2009===
*Project team testing
*Bug fixes
*Performance evaluation

===Public launch: ASIH meeting, Portland, Oregon - July 22, 2009===
